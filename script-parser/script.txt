Introduction

"Neon Genesis Evangelion (Japanese title: Shin-seiki Evangelion)" is 
the brand new anime from GAINAX, which is famous for "Gunbuster" and 
"Nadia: The Secret Blue Water." The first episode of it was broadcasted
 in Tokyo Japan on October 4, 1995.

I love Gunbuster very much. Although I expected much from it, they 
never failed to measure up to my expectations. It was a great anime 
of supreme high quality and the direct descendant of Gunbuster. 
Never miss this TV anime series if you like it.

OPENING THEME SONG 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is in A.D. 2015. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *A Gigantic strange creature cruising underwater in the submerged
  city

 *A group of tanks whose guns are pointed at the city

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Radio: Today at 12:30, a state of special emergency has been declared
   all over Kanto and Chubu districts around Tokai district. Please
   take refuge in the designated shelters. Repeat. Today ...... 

     #Tokai is the district between Tokyo and Nagoya. Kanto and Chubu
     #contains Tokai and the large area north of it.

 *All destination panels at the station show 'All lines are out of
  service'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *In the car, someone is driving

Misato: Why, of all times, have I missed him at such a time?! ......
   What am I going to do? 

     #Japanese below the photo of Shinji is his name 'Ikari Shinji'
     #written by katakana. He wears a school uniform, which most of
     #junior high school students must wear in Japan. His wear in
     #this episode seems a kind of them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *A boy is calling in a telephone booth

Phone: All normal lines are out of order due to the state of special
   emergency. 

Shinji: Out of order ... I shouldn't have come ... 

     #The Traffic panel shows "Tokyo-3: 13km, Gotenba: 35km." Gotenba
     #is located at the foot of Mt. Fuji.

     #You can see some handwriting on the photo. It says: Dear
     #Shinji-kun. Because I'll come to meet you, wait for me, please.
     #Attention to here (her bust)!

Shinji: I may not be able to meet her. I can't help it. I'll go to
   the shelter. 

 *A sudden strong wind

Shinji: Uh 

Shinji: Ahh 

 *A gigantic creature walking

Shinji: Ahhhhhh! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Operational Display

     #I wonder if the place where I think UN Force Headquarters in
     #Tokyo-3 is the same place as where I regard as Nerv
     #Headquarters.

     #I'll check it. But unfortunately I don't have enough information
     #to confirm it.

Female Voice: The identifiable moving object is still approaching
   this place. 

Male Voice: We've got the visual image of the target. I'll transfer
   it to the main screen. 

 *Two men (Gendo and Fuyutsuki)

Fuyutsuki: It must be 15 years. 

Gendo: Yes, certainly. 

Fuyutsuki: Angels.

EPISODE: 1 

ANGEL ATTACK 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Attacks against Angel

Aircraft: All missiles hit the target! 

Aircraft: Ah! 

 *An UN aircraft crashed

Shinji: Ahh! 

 *Misato stops the car and opens the door

Misato: Sorry to have kept you waiting. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Male Voice: The target is still intact. It's moving toward Tokyo-3 as
   before. 

Female Voice: It cannot be stopped with the air force firepower. 

 *Missile attacks

 *3 commanders of the UN force

Sub Commander A: Total war! Mobilize all divisions at Atsugi and
   Iruma Bases to the battle! 

     #Atsugi the US bases in Japan. Iruma is the Japanese Air Defense
     #Force's base.

Sub Commander B: Don't hold back! Smash the target at any cost! 

 *Missile attack. But no effect.

Sub Commander A: Why?! It must have been a direct hit! 

Sub Commander B: The tank battalion was totally destroyed. Guided
   missiles and gun bombs have no effect on it... 

Sub Commander A: Useless! With such poor firepower, we'll get
   nowhere! 

 *Gendo & Fuyutsuki

Fuyutsuki: It is protected by AT-field as we expected. 

Fuyutsuki: As I thought, AT-field has been expanded. 

Gendo: Normal weapons have no effect on Angels. 

 *A phone call

One of Cmdr: Yes, sir. I'll employ that as previously arranged. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Angel in the distance

 *Misato looking through field glasses

Misato: Hey! It can't be... Are they going to use a N2-mine?! Lie
   down! 

 *A big explosion

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Sub Cmdr A: We did it! 

Sub Cmdr B: Sorry that we've left nothing for you to do. 

Female Voice: Shock wave is coming! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Misato and Shinji near the overturned car

Misato: Are you all right? 

Shinji: Yes, but something is crunchy in my mouth. 

Misato: That's fine! Are you ready? 

Misato: Here goes! 

 *They succeeded in turning over the car.

Misato: Thanks a lot. Good job. 

Shinji: Katsuragi-san... 

Misato: Call me Misato. 

Shinji: Me, too. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Cmdr-in-Chief: How is the target? 

Female Voice: It can't be captured due to radio wave obstruction. 

Sub Cmdr A: It was such a massive explosion. It has been brought to
   an end. 

Male Voice: Sensors are operating again. 

Female Voice: An energy reaction in the center of the explosion! 

Sub Cmdr A: Whaaaaaaaat?! 

Male Voice: Visual Image is regained. 

Commanders: Oh...! 

Cmdr-in-Chief: It was our trump card ... Unbelievable ... 

Sub Cmdr A: What a monster! 

 *Angel regenerating itself

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Misato driving her broken car and making a phone call

Misato: Sure. Don't worry. He is under my protection at top priority.
   Prepare a car train for us. A linear one, please. Yes. I'll bear
   the full responsibility for him because it was my idea to meet him
   in the first place. Bye. 

Misato (thinking): But it's terrible! I've just restored my car... It
   is a jalopy now... 

Misato (thinking): 33 loan repayments to go ... and the repair
   costs... 

Misato (thinking): What was even worse, my only good clothes have
   been ruined... 

Shinji: Misato-san... 

Misato (thinking): I was in high spirits. My goodness... 

Shinji: I say, Misato-san... 

Misato: Eh, what did you say? 

Shinji: Is it OK that you did such a thing...? 

 *Batteries which she seems to stole...

Misato: Ah, It's OK. No problem. It is during an emergency... We
   can't do anything if the car doesn't run. In the addition, I am an
   international officer even if I don't seem like it. 

Shinji: That doesn't seem like a very good excuse. 

Misato: Uninteresting boy. You look so calm, very unlike your pretty
   face. 

Shinji: You think so ... 

Misato: Hmm, are you angry? Sorry, I'm sorry. It's natural because
   you a boy. 

Shinji: You are childish for your age, aren't you? 

 *Misato driving a car roughly

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Injured Angel stands in the plain

Fuyutsuki: It is regenerating itself as we expected. 

Gendo: Otherwise, it would be useless as an independent weapon. 

Cmdr: Ohhh... 

Fuyutsuki: Oh, I'm impressed. It can also amplify its own functions. 

Gendo: In addition, it has acquired intelligence. 

Fuyutsuki: The next invasion is a matter of time. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *A car train departing from the station

Announce: The gate is closing. Attention, please. The train is about
   to depart. This train ... 

Shinji: The special agency Nerv? 

Misato: Yes, the secret organization directly attached to the United
   Nations. 

Shinji: It's the one which my father belongs to. 

Misato: Yeah, well. Do you know what he does? 

Shinji: I heard from the teacher that it's an important job for
   protecting the human race. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Gendo standing before 3 commanders of the UN force in Nerv
  Headquarters

Cmdr-in-Chief: You are the commander of this operation from now.
   We'll watch how you will deal with it. 

Gendo: Yes, sir. 

Sub Cmdr B: Thinking of our available weapons, I'll have to admit
   that we have no effective measures against the target. 



Cmdr-in-Chief: But, are you confident of defeating it? 

Gendo: Nerv exists for that purpose. 

Cmdr-in-Chief: We expect much from you. 

     #UN Commanders disappear.

Female Voice: The target is still as it was. 

Male Voice: The present effective rate of the interception is 7.5 %. 

Fuyutsuki: The U. N. Troops can't help it.... What are you going to
   do? 

Gendo: I'll activate Evangelion Unit One. 

Fuyutsuki: Unit One? But we have no pilot. 

Gendo: No problem. Another spare will be brought. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Shinji and Misato in her car on the car train

Shinji: Are we going to where my father is? 

Misato: Well. Yes, we are. 

Shinji: Father ... 

Misato: By the way, were you given an ID by your father? 

Shinji: Oh, yes. 

Shinji: Here it is. 

Misato: Thanks! 

     #Japanese on the top of the paper is 'Ikari Shinji'. The one at
     #the bottom is 'Come! Ikari Gendo'.

Misato: Then, read this. 

     #'Top Secret' is on Misato's side. 'Welcome to Nerv' is on
     #Shinji's side.

Shinji: It's about my father's work... Are there anything for me to
   do? 

Shinji: I can't say I'm surprised. He can't write to me ... unless he
   wants me to do anything. 

Misato: I know. You consider him to be a tough customer. Me too. 

 *Underground city appears

Shinji: Ah, great! It's a real geofront! 

     # 'Geo-front' is English word which was made in Japan. It means
     #underground space which the people can use for living or
     #manufacture etc. Because Japan is small, the development plan
     #of underground space is studied.

Misato: That's right. This is our secret base, Nerv Headquarters.
   It's also the foundation for rebuilding the world and the fort for
   the human race.

NEON GENESIS EVANGELION EPISODE:1 ANGEL ATTACK 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Shinji and Misato on the moving pavement

Misato: That's strange. I'm sure this is the right way ... 

     #Japanese on the top means 'Nerv Headquarters'. The handwritten
     #one on the map means 'HERE!' The handwritten 'WC' beside the
     #map means 'lavatory/rest room'.

     #Japanese on the top means 'Nerv Headquarters'. The handwritten
     #one on the map means 'HERE!'

Misato: I'd really rather not wear a skirt this place. Anyway, where
   has Ritsuko gone? Sorry that I'm not familiar with this place. 

Shinji: We passed here some time ago. 

Misato: But don't worry. All systems exist to be used. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Announce: Chief of Project E at Section 1 of Technical Department,
   Dr. Akagi Ritsuko, Dr. Akagi Ritsuko. Please contact with Captain
   Katsuragi Misato at Section 1 of Operation Department immediately. 

     #Misato's rank is 'Ichi-i' in Japanese.

     #Japanese on the cylinder seems to means 'Air'.

 *Ritsuko takes her wet suit off.

Ritsuko: I'm dumbfound. She must have got lost again. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 * Ritsuko coming into the elevator which Shinji and Misato took

Misato: Uhhm. Ha...Hi, Ritsuko... 

Ritsuko: What did you do, Captain Katsuragi? We are short of hands
   and time! 

Misato: Sorry... 

Ritsuko: He is that boy. 

Misato: Yes, 'the third child' according to Malduck's report. 

Ritsuko: Nice to meet you. 

Shinji: Ah ... me too. 

Misato: He is very much like his father ...... in that they aren't
   lovable. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Gendo descending by the lift

Gendo: Well, I trust you. 

Fuyutsuki: They'll meet after three years' interval. 

Male Voice: Sub-Commander, the target has begun to move again. 

Fuyutsuki: Well. Red alert! All hands to battle stations! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Shinji, Misato and Ritsuko coming up on the lift with a pink
  background

Female Voice: Repeat, Red alert! All hands to battle stations!
   Prepare for the interception of the enemies on the ground. 

Misato: Did you hear what she said? 

Ritsuko: That's serious. 

Misato: By the way, how is Unit One? 

Ritsuko: It is equipped with B type. It is being frozen. 

Misato: Does it really work? I heard that it has never worked yet. 

Ritsuko: The possibility of it working is 0.000000001%. O9-system
   seems a good name for it. 

Misato: You mean it won't work, don't you? 

Ritsuko: Oh, how rude you are! It isn't zero. 

Misato: It's only a number. Anyway, to say "It doesn't work at all"
   ... will be no excuse. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *A ship going on the pink water

 *Only a line of light coming through the entrance

 *A sudden blackout

Shinji: Uh,uh, it's pitch dark. 

 *The big face of Evangelion before Shinji

Shinji: Ah, face ... A gigantic robot ... 

Ritsuko: You can't find this in the manual. 

Shinji: Eh? 

Ritsuko: This is the Multi-purpose Humanoid Fighting Machine
   EVANGELION which the humanity finally developed. 

Shinji: Is it also Father's work? 

Gendo: Yes. 

 *Gendo appears at the top of the room

Gendo: It's been a long time. 

Shinji: Father ... 

Gendo: Sally. 

Misato: Sally?! Unit Zero is being frozen... No kidding ... Do you
   mean that you'll activate Unit One? 

Ritsuko: We have no other choice. 

Misato: Hey! We can't have Rei get it on. We have no pilots. 

Ritsuko: One has been just delivered. 

Misato: Are you serious? 

Ritsuko: Ikari Shinji-kun, you will get into it. 

Misato: But, even in the case of Rei, it took seven full months for
   her to synchronize with Eva. 

Ritsuko: You may only take a seat. We'd never expect more from you. 

Misato: But ... 

Ritsuko: At present, the interception against Angel's attack is top
   priority. We have no choice but to have someone get into it even
   if there is a little potential for synchronizing with Eva. 

Misato: You may be right... 

Shinji: Why did you call me? 

Gendo: For exactly the reason you think. 

Shinji: Do you mean that I should get into it and fight against the
   guy which I saw. 

Shinji: No way! What are you saying now?! I have been thinking that
   you didn't want me?! 

Gendo: I called you just because I need you now. 

Shinji: Why me ...? 

Gendo: Because others can't ... 

Shinji: I can't do that. I've neither seen it nor heard it. Why are
   you saying that I can do it? 

Gendo: Hear the explanations. 

Shinji: No. I can't. It's impossible. 

Gendo: If you get into it, stop wasting time. Otherwise, get out! 

 *Many maintenance men looking at the scenery anxiously

 *Angel attacking the ground above the Nerv Headquarters

Gendo: That guy seems to have found this place. 

Ritsuko: Shinji-kun, we have no time. 

Misato: Get into it. 

Shinji: No way. After coming all the way, it's ridiculous. 

Misato: Shinji-kun... Why did you come here? Don't run away, from
   your father, above all from yourself. 

Shinji: I understand. But, I don't think I can do that! 

Gendo: Fuyutsuki. 

 *Fuyutsuki on the screen

Gendo: Wake up Rei. 

Fuyutsuki: Is she available. 

Gendo: She is still alive at least. 

Fuyutsuki: Yes. 

Gendo: Rei. 

Rei: Yes. 

Gendo: The spare turned out to be useless. 

Gendo: Again. 

Rei: Yes. 

Ritsuko: Reconfigure the system of Unit One for Rei! Restart! 

Female Voice: Yes, sir. I'll stop the current process and restart it. 

Shinji: I'm unnecessary as I expected... 

 *Rei on the bed coming in

 *Angel attacking again

Shinji: Watch out! 

 *Eva protected Shinji with the right hand

Shinji: Ah! 

Male Voice: Eva moved! What was the matter with it?! 

Male Voice: It tore off the binding attached to the right arm. 

Ritsuko: It's impossible! Even the entry plug has never been inserted
   yet. It can't move! 

Misato: It reacts without the interface... Or rather, did it protect
   him? ... He can do it! 

 *Shinji runs to Rei and holds her

 *Rei suffering very much

Shinji: Don't run away, Don't run away, Don't run away, Don't run
   away, Don't run away ...... I'll do it. I'll get into it. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Staff: Freezing Process has finished.

Operator: Begin the first connection. 

 *Shinji in the entry plug (a cockpit)

Ritsuko: Commence LCL injection into entry plug 

Shinji: Hmm? What is this? Ah, ah, ah, Uguh...... 

Ritsuko: Don't worry. After your lungs fill with LCL, it'll directly
   supply you with oxygen. You'll get used to it soon. 

Shinji: Fuah, guhah... I feel sick. 

Misato: Stand it! You are a boy, aren't you?! 

Staff: Connect to the main power supply. 

Staff: Transmit power to all circuits. 

Staff: Yes, sir. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Operator: The second contact is beginning. 

Operator: I'll commence the second contact. 

Operator: The connection of the A10-nerve is operational. 

Ritsuko: Japanese has been fixed to the system as the fundamental
   rules for the operation of Eva. All initial
   contacts are all right. 

Maya: Connect the mutual lines. The rate of synchronization is 41.3%. 

Ritsuko: Great! 

Maya: All values of the harmonics are normal. Everything is under
   control. 

Ritsuko: It will go! 

Misato: Ready for launching. 

 *Evangelion

Staff: Release the 1st lock bolt! 

Staff: It has been released.

Operator: The course is clear. All green. 

Ritsuko: It's ready for launching. 

Misato: OK. Are you OK?

Introduction

   "Neon Genesis Evangelion (Japanese title: Shin-seiki Evangelion)" is 
the brand new anime from GAINAX. The first episode of it was 
broadcasted in Tokyo Japan on October 4, 1995.

   I've fallen in love with 'Eva' like 'Gunbuster' which GAINAX made many 
years ago. Eva is the aggressive animation series of extremely high 
quality. NEVER MISS! By all means, you must see it *NOW*. If you like 
Eva, you can buy commercial videos/LDs and even send the balance 
to GAINAX *LATER*. The most important thing is that GAINAX will 
finally get enough money. 

   I believe that some of you will fall in love with Eva and want to buy 
Eva LD Box (even in Japanese) when it releases in the future. I'm very 
happy that I can help you to fall in love with Eva and Gainax.

OPENING THEME SONG

------------------------------------------------------------------------



*Eva is ready for the battle against 'ANGEL'. Shinji is in Eva Unit One.
*Misato and Ritsuko are in the operating room of Nerv underground.

Misato: Are you ready, Shinji-kun?

Shinji: Ah, yes.

Misato: Remove the final safety lock! Evangelion Unit One, lift off!

Misato: Shinji-kun, think about only walking now.

Shinji: Walking ...

Ritsuko: It 's walking!

Shinji: Waliking ...

*Eva falls forward.

Misato: Shinji-kun, come on! Hurry up, stand up as soon as possible!

*ANGEL lifts Eva up and grasps Eva's left arm tightly.

Misato: Shinji-kun, keep your head. It isn't your arm.

Ritsuko: How is Eva's protection system?

Maya: The signal doesn't work.

Makoto: Field has not been developed!

Ritsuko: It won't do?!

*ANGEL broke Eva's left arm.

Maya: The left arm has been damaged.

Makoto: The circuits have snapped.

Misato: Shinji-kun, dodge it!

*ANGEL attacks on Eva's head.

Maya: The front area of the head is cracked!

Ritsuko: The armoring won't stand any more.

     #Japanese word above 'EMERGENCY' has the same meaning.

Shigeru: Head damaged! Damages unidentified!

Maya: The nerves for control is snapping one after another.

Makoto: The pilot, no response.

Misato: Shinji-kun!
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Shinji: An unknown ceiling ......

TITLE
------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPISODE: 2
UNKNOWN CEILING
------------------------------------------------------------------------

     #In this series, there are a Japanese title and an English one for each 
        episode. The English one has different meaning from the Japanese 
        one. This episode has 'Mishiranu, Tenjo (Unknown Ceiling)' and
        'BEAST' as the titles.

*A tent in the center of the ANGEL's self-exploseion

     #Japanese words above 'DANGER, KEEP OUT' has the same 
        meanings, literally 'DANGER, KEEP OUT AREA'. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Lorentz: The second coming of ANGEL ......It's too abrupt.

Member(yellow): It's the same as fifteen years ago. A disaster always 
   comes without any notice.

Member(red): It may be fortunate for us from the view that our prior 
   investment came to nothing ......

Member(blue): Things have never turned out yet. If it is useless, it's the 
   waste.

Member(yellow): That's right. As for the mesures with ANGELs which 
   have been known commonly now and the information control , Nerv 
   must cope with them appropriately and abruptly.

Gendo: The matters have been done. Feel easy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------



*Misato is changing TV channels in the tent

*12 Channel

     #'Goverment's Urgent Announcement for Press'(center) and 'On the 
        spot broadcasting'(right) at the bottom of the display. 

TV: The Government announcement on the state of special emergency 
   yesterday says this morning ......

*Channel 4
     #'Mayumi, the Chief Cabinet Secretary' at the bottom.
     
TV: In this incident, ......

*Channel 8
TV: The U. N. forces in Japan ......

     #'BS' means a statellite broadcasting.

*Misato is fannning herself.

Misato: The announcement was 'Scenario D-22'. The facts were hushed 
   up again.

Ritsuko: The people of Public Relations Department seem to be glad 
   because they got the things to do at last.

Misato: They seems very optimistic.

Ritsuko: Well ...... The truth is that everyone is afraid.

Misato: Of course!
------------------------------------------------------------------------



Lorentz(?): That's what it is.

Member(green): But , Ikari-kun, Nerv and Eva ...... you can use them in 
   the better ways, can't you?

Member(yellow): The costs of the repairs for Unit Zero and Unit One

Member(red): Human Complement Project, this is what you must do 
   at the top priority.

Member(yellow): That's right. That project is the only hope under such 
   hopeless circumstances, for us.

Lorentz: Anyway, although ANGELs came again, it can't be allowed 
   that the project will be behind schedule. As for the budgets, we'll 
   consider them.

Member(?): Well, the committee will take over now.

Member(yellow): Ikari-kun, thanks.

Lorentz: Ikari, you can't go back.

Gendo: I understand. Human have no time.

   the human! It's really a scientific success!

Ritsuko: Shinji-kun has recover consciousness.

Misato: How is he?

Ritsuko: No external wounds. He is somewhat confused in his memory.

Misato: It cannot be ...... Is it a mental contamination .....?

Ritsuko: I heard that you need not worry about it.

Misato: So ...... Quite so. Because suddenly that happened ......

Ritsuko: It's no wonder. A severe burden was imposed on his cranial 
   nerves.

Misato: M-I-N-D, you seem to mistake?

Shinji: Ah...... yes.

*Shinji and Misato do JANKEN (the game of 'papar, stone and scissors)

     #JANKEN is similar to TOSSING A COIN. JANKEN is a convenient

     #do together and need only their own hands.
     #Rule: You can do three kinds of hand's forms, GU, CHOKI, PA.  
     #GU is 'stone', CHOKI is 'Scissors' and PA is 'paper'. GU can defeat 
     #CHOKI, CHOKI can defeat PA and PA can defeat GU. Guess the 
     #reasons. The situation when none can win is called AIKO.
     #In this case, Misato who showed GU finally win the game over

   agreement for making the frozen Unit Zero restart until then. 

Ritsuko: What a pain ... they have ......

   live, I let them do that.

   charge of him, didn't you?

Shut up!

Misato: Then I regarded him as my tool. I'm as the same as Ritsuko. 
   Although we defeated the ANGEL, ...... I don't seem happy.

*Shinji lays on the bed.

Shinji: This is an unknown ceiling, too. It's natural ... because I don't

Maya: Impossible. It is totally out of control.

Misato: What!!

Ritsuko: Eva can't touch ANGEL.

Introduction

   "Neon Genesis Evangelion (Japanese title: Shin-seiki Evangelion)" is 
the brand new anime from GAINAX. The first episode of it was 
broadcasted in Tokyo Japan on October 4, 1995.

   I love 'Eva'! Eva is the aggressive animation series of high 
quality. Don't miss it! By all means, you must see it *NOW*. If 
you like Eva, you can buy commercial videos/LDs or even send the 
balance to GAINAX *LATER*. The most important thing is that GAINAX
will finally get enough money.

   My impression of Episode 3: This is really elaborately worked.
I mention not only the quality of animation but the one of the 
story, especially thepsychological description and the continuity.
I'm surprised that Shinji, a pilot of Eva, is thoroughly being 
driven into a corner mentally. I believe that he will rise from 
the hell on earth, like Noriko of Gunbuster. Now he is running away.
Because this is not just a robot animation, some can synchronize 
with it and others feel frustration. Of course, I've completely 
synchronized with it. Of course, the battle scenes of Eva vs Angel
are very exciting. This worth seeing, definitely!

   I want to improve my skill, I need your help. If you find the 
unsuitable expressions for the characters or scenes, please send 
me your advices. Only your e-mails can encourage me. And correct 
my translation, please!  Only few resopnses will make me stop my 
further works. Of course, It's OK that you'll send your comments
not now but after you see the videos. But I'm looking forward to
any messages from you anytime.

OPENING THEME SONG

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Shinji is in the entry plug of Eva Unit One.

 *He is trained by Ritsuko, who is in charge of the development of
  Eva.

 *Ritsuko gives him the instruction from the operation room.

Ritsuko: Good morning, Shinji-kun. How are you? 

 *Shinji's face with no animation and monotonous voice (tottaly
  lifeless).

Shinji: I've got used to it ...... I think I have nothing wrong. 

Ritsuko: That's fine. Appearance positions, an emergency power
   source, locations of armed buildings and recovery spots. Do you
   keep all of them in your mind? 

Shinji: Maybe ...... 

Ritsuko: Well, I'll review the lesson again. Eva usually works with
   electric power supply from the cable. If Eva use the internal
   battery in an emergency, it can work only for one minute with its
   full strength or for five minutes at most even with gain. 

Shinji: Yes. 

Ritsuko: Now, let's resume the lesson of 'Induction Mode' where we
   left off yesterday. 

 *The panel which shows the information of the internal battery of
  Eva.

     #Japanese words are with English. "ACTIVE TIME REMAINING" ,
     #"INTERNAL" , "MAIN BATTERY SYSTEM" . Eva usually can move with
     #the internal battery only for 5 minutes.

 *Eva aims the rifle at Angel who appeared in Episode 1.

 *The sight display.

Ritsuko: Aim at the target in the center of the sights ...... switch
   on! 

 *Eva shoots the rifle but misses the target.

Ritsuko: Keep your head. Aim at the target in the center. 

Shinji: Switch ...... 

 *Eva shoots the rifle again and defeats Angel.

Ritsuko: Next! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Eva with some cables is seen through the windows of the operarion
  room.

 *Eva continues to shoot the rifle again and again.

Maya: Well, I wonder how he has brought himself to pilot it.
   Shinji-kun. 

Ritsuko: That he goes along with what others say obediently ......
   It's how to get onin his life, isn't it? 

 *Shinji looks so haggard and vacant. He repeats the instruction like
  a spell.

Shinji: Aim at the target in the center, switch ... Aim at the target
   in the center, switch ... Aim at the target in the center, switch
   ... Aim at the target in the center, switch ... Aim at the target
   in the center ......

EPISODE 3: A transfer 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *The room where Misato and Shinji live together.

 *Female voice is coming from a radio.

 *Shinji knocks the FUSUMA of Misato's room and opens(slides) it.

 *Misato has tucked herself in a FUTON(bed).

     #A fusuma is a papered sliding door which is used to partition
     #off rooms in a Japanese house.

Shinji: Misato-san, it's morning already. 

 *Misato answers him with tucking herself in a FUTON. She seems so
  sleepy.

Misato: I was on night duty until just some time ago. Today I have
   olny to appear at the office until the evening. So, please let me
   sleep! 

Shinji: Then, I ...... 

Misato: Is today Thursday? Burnable garbage, please. 

Shinji: Yes. 

Misato: Have you got used to the school? 

Shinji: Yes. 

Misato: So. ITTERASSHAI. 

Shinji: ITTEKIMASU. 

     #JAPANESE GREETING LESSON: We always say 'ITTERASSHAI' when
     #someone who belongs to the place leave there. We always say
     #'ITTEKIMASU' when we leave home (or the place where we belong
     #to,like the office).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Shinji puts the garbage in the garbage collection spot for the
  residents of the apartment.

     #JAPANESE SOCIAL RULES LESSON: We must segregate garbage.
     #Thursday is the day for burnable garbage collection in the area
     #where Misato live.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *There is a phone call to Misato.

 *Misato's room is still very untidy but it tidier than it was.

 *She picks up the receiver. She is still tucking herself in the
  futon.

Misato: Yes. Hello. Oh, it's you, isn't it, Ritsuko. 

Ritsuko: How have you been? Do you get along with him? 

Misato: Him? Ah, Shinji-kun? It's two weeks after he transferred to
   the school. He is as he was. He has never got any telephone calls. 

Ritsuko: Telephone calls? 

 *The portable phone which she handed to him is on his desk

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Shinji is walking to the school alone

Misato: As it is a necessity, I handed a portable one to him a long
   time ago. He doesn't seem to have used it nor got a phone call
   from anybody. He has no friends, though I'm not sure. 

 *Ritsuko is calling at her desk in the office

Ritsuko: He seems to have an unsuited personality for making friends,
   doesn't he? Do you know a story of 'Hedgehogs' dilemma'? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Shoes boxes of the school

Misato: Hedgehogs? That thorny ones? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Classmates is talking and playing in the classroom.

If a hedgehog want to give his warmth to other hedgehogs, the nearer
   they approach, the more they injure each other. It's the same as
   the people. As he is frightened of aches in his heart, he seems so
   cowardly now. 

 *Shinji comes in the classroom silently.

 *Rei is sitting at her desk with seeing outside alone.

Misato: He will realize in time that growing up is to get a sense of
   distance among the others for hurt feelings each other. 

 *The talk of Misato and Ritsuko finished.

 *A boy is palying a model of aircraft. Kensuke recording the model by
  his video camera.

Boy: Gyuuuuuun, Dogyugyugyuuuuun 

Kensuke: What, Class Rep? 

 *Hikari have a class journal.

     #Horaki Hikari is a class representative(IINCHO). Kensuke calls
     #her 'IINCHO'. I'm not sure if there are the similar title of
     #schools outside Japan.

Hikari: Did you hand yesterday's print to Suzuhara, like I asked you
   to? 

     #A print is a piece of paper which is written the information or
     #messages from the school to the parents of the students.

Kensuke: Ah, huh, there didn't seem to be anybody in Toji's house. 

Hikari: Aida-kun, you are on good terms with Suzuhara, aren't you?
   Why aren't you worrying about him? 

Kensuke: I'm not sure, but he may probably be hurt badly? 

Hikari: Really? In that robot incident? TV news said that nobody was
   hurt ...... 

 *The center of the explosion

Kensuke: That can't be! You saw the center of the explosion, didn't
   you? The Units of not only Iruma and Komatsu but Misawa and Kyushu
   have been sent out. I'm sure that there were more than 10 or 20
   people injured. Probably some may have been killed ...... 

 *Toji comes in the classroom.

Kensuke: Toji! 

Hikari: Suzuhara! 

Toji: How! The number of students seem to have dropped drastically. 

Kensuke: Evacuation, evacuation. Many have transferred to another
   schools. That's not surprising. There was such a real war in the
   city. 

Toji: You are the only man who are pleased to see real battles. 

Kensuke: It sure is. How have you been? You have been absent for such
   a long time. Did you involved in the incident? 

Toji: My younger sister, she was buried under a heap of rubble. She
   escaped death but has been in the hospital since then. My father
   and grandfather work for the research center. They can't desert
   their posts now. If I were not with her, she would become left
   alone. Even so, how poor the pilot of that robot was! I'm really
   burned up. The robot on our side destroyed the city! What was he
   doing?! 

Kensuke: Did you hear a rumor of the transfer student? 

Toji: A transfer student? 

Kensuke: Look at that boy. He transferred to this school while you
   were absent. Do you understand it was just after the incident? Do
   you think it's strange? 

 *A teacher comes in.

Hikari: All rise! 

     #At the beginning and the end of a lesson, we stand up, bow and
     #sit down to the shouts of a student like 'All rise!', 'Bow' and
     #'Sit down'.

 *an empty classroom

 *a blackboard

 *portable computers on the desks of the students

Teacher: The hardest trials for the human race began then. In the
   last year of the 20nd century, the massive meteorite, which came
   from the outer space, fell in the Antarctic Continent. It cause
   the ice of the continent melted in a moment. As the result, the
   water level of the oceans went up, the earth axis fluctuated and
   abnormal weather which threatened the existence of the living
   things occurred all over the world. 

 *calling sound from Shinji's computer

Teacher: Economic collapse, racial disputes and civil wars. The
   people who survived them sufferred hell of all kinds. 

 *The following message on Shinji's desplay

E-mail: "Is it true that you are a pilot of that robot? Y/N" 

 *Shinji is surprised and trys to find the sender.

Teacher: But 15 years after that ...... only for 15 years, we have
   revived the world so far. This is not only the result of the
   excellence of the human race, 

 *The next message comes to prompt him to answer.

E-mail: It's true, isn't it? 

Teacher: ...... but the one of blood, sweat, tears and efforts of
   your fathers and mothers. 

 *Shinji input "YES" .

 *Many students stand up and gather around him.

Students: Ehhhhhhhh!! 

 *The teacher stands beside the windows and look outside through them.
  He is too old to hear the noises which the students make.

Teacher: In those days, I lived in Nebukawa. It is already ...... 

 *Hikari stands up and shout!

Hikari: Listen, everybody! We are still in class, aren't we? Take
   your seats! 

 *Rei has no interest in the fuss and is looking outside as she was.

Girl: Ah, you always try to take the initiative! 

Boy: Don't mind. Don't mind. 

Hikari: I do mind that! 

 *Shinji is surrounded by many students and asked many questions by
  them.

Girl: How were you selected? 

Girl: Did you have any examinations? 

Girl: Were you frightened? 

Girl: What is a cockpit like? 

Shinji: Ah, uh, I must keep such a things secret ...... 

Gril: What is the name of the robot? 

Shinji: I'm not sure, but they called it Eva or Unit One ...... 

Girl: Eva? 

Boy: What 's the deadly attack? 

Shinji: It's some knife and the vibrations ...... like ultrasonic
   wave ...... 

Girl: Even so, that's amazing! He is the pride of our school, isn't
   he? 

Boy: Great! 

 *The chime which tells the end of the lesson rings.

Teacher: ...... Consequently, ...... What? 

Teacher: Well, so much for today. 

Girl: Where do you live, Ikari-kun? 

Girl: Do you live in the old area of the city? 

Hikari: All rise! Bow! ...... Hey, everybody! Only at the end, do
   properly ...... 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *Toji hits Shinji behind the school building at the schoolyard.
  Shinji fell on the ground.

Toji: Sorry, transferee. But I have to hit you. I've never satisfied
   unless I hit you. 

Kensuke: Sorry, but his younger sister got hurt in the battle. That's
   the reason. 

Shinji: Speaking of myself, I'm not doing that by choice. 

 *Toji comes back and hit Shinji again.

 *Rei comes and says.

Rei: An emergency call ...... I'll go first ...... 

 *Rei runs away.

Hikari: Come on! Why haven't you done it before. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Toji: Well, What is that? 

Kensuke: I want to see that even only once until my death. 

Toji: The battle above? 

Kensuke: I'm afraid if the next enemy will come soon ...... 

Toji: Kensuke, what guy you are! 

Kensuke: If I miss this chance, I might not forever ...... Say,
   please help me to unlock the gate. 

Toji: If you go out, you'll be killed. 

Kensuke: If we are here in the shelter, I wonder if we survive. Since
   I may be killed anyway, I want to see it before then. 

Toji: What a fool! What do you think Nerv exists for?! 

Kensuke: What do you think the fighting machine of Nerv is?! The
   robot which the transferee pilots. At the last time, he protected
   us. But you hit him like that. Two hit at that! 

Kensuke: If he doesn't want to pilot the robot, we all will be
   killed. You have an obligation to watch his battle, don't you? 

Toji: There's no other choice. You are really faithful to your
   desires, aren't you?

 *Eva shoots the rifle at Angel.

Misato: Fool! The enemy is hidden by smoke of explosion!

  Angel but doesn't attack Angel.

Toji: Why won't he fight?! 

Kensuke: Because we are here, ...... he can't move as he likes. 

Maya: Unit One. Active time remaining is 3 minutes and 28 seconds! 

Misato: Shinji-kun, let them into the cockpit. After they are picked
   up, retreat for the present. And come back later! 

Ritsuko: Why do you think it is possible that ccivilians can be taken
   in the entry plug without permission?! 

Misato: I permit it. 

Ritsuko: You are exceeding your authority, Captain Katsuragi. 

Maya: Unit One, Active time remaining is 3 minutes! 

Misato: Hold Eva under the present orders and then eject the entry
   plug! Hurry up! 

 *The entry plug is ejected.

Misato: You guys, get into! Be quick! 

 *Blackout.

Toji: What? It's water! 

Kensuke: Camera. Oh, my camera! 

 *Ritusko and Maya check the information on the status display.

Maya: Troubles in the nervous system!

   detected in the nervous pulses. 

Shinji: Uh 

 *Angel went away from Eva.

Misato: Now, retreat! 

 *Eva stands up slowly.

Misato: The recovery route is No.34. Go back to the east side of the
   mountain!

Shinji: Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away ...... 

 *Eva takes a Progressive Knife from the shoulder part.

Makoto: Progressive Knife equipped!

Maya: 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 

Maya: Eva Unit One has stopped actions. 

Makoto: The target is completely silent. 

 *Shinji is sobbing at the pilot seat heavily.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 *It's raining.

 *kensuke is operating a computer.

Shinji: Until today, three days have already passed ...... 

Kensuke: After when we were really raked over the coals ...... 

Toji: After he was absent from the school, I mean. 

Kensuke: Who is he? 

Toji: I'm saying about the transferee, the transferee. How has he
   been after that? 

Kensuke: Are you worrying about him? 

Toji: I'm not especially worrying ...... 

Kensuke: For being such a tactless, you are stubborn, aren't you?
   After that, if you said to him that you're sorry, you would have
   ended up not suffering from mental agony for three days. 

 *Kensuke hands a piece of paper to Toji.

Kensuke: Look, the phone number of the transferee. If you worry about
   him, try calling him. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Trailer 

   Shinji can't overcome the weakness of his mind and run away even from
   Misato. But the organization takes him back easily. There aren't
   any kind words. Next time, "Rain, after he runs away" . Next time,
   of course, service, service!

Introduction

"Neon Genesis Evangelion (Japanese title: Shin-seiki Evangelion)" is
the brand new anime from GAINAX. The first episode of it was
broadcasted in Tokyo Japan on October 4, 1995. I love 'Eva'! Eva is
the aggressive animation series of high quality. Don't miss it! By all
means, you must see it *NOW*. If you like Eva, you can buy commercial
videos/LDs and repay an obligation *LATER*. My impression of Episode
4: Be careful! This isn't only a robot animation. No robot this
time. Shinji is cracking up and runs away from everything, even from
Misato. The process that Shinji, a hedgehog, opens up to others has
been elaborately represented. I like the last scene although it is
common. This is a heartwarming drama. This worth seeing, definitely! 
If you find the unsuitable expressions for the characters or scenes,
please send me your advice. Only your e-mails can encourage me. Of
course, It's OK that you'll send your comments not now but after you
see the videos. I've revised the script of Episode 1 with some
friends' help. You had better check the Home Page just before you see
the videos.

OPENING THEME SONG
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Sign on the door 'Shin-chan's room' 
* Misato knocking on the door of Shinji's room

Misato: Shinji-kun, get up! Why do you keep staying away from the
        school?! It's five days until today. Unit One completely works
        well. For being a pilot, you want to leave it like that?

Misato: Shinji-kun? 

* Misato opens the door but his room is empty 

* Misato finds his ID of Nerv and a letter to Misato. Addressee 
'Katsuragi Misato sama' on the envelope.

Misato: He's run away...... That's not surprising.

EPISODE 

4: Hedgehog's Dilemma
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Two people seem to visit the room 
* The door bell rings 
* Misato opens the door 

Misato: Shinji-kun?! 

Toji: Er... 

Kensuke:We are Shinji's classmates, Aida and Suzuhara. 

Misato: Aida-kun and Suzuhara-kun?

Toji & Kensuke: Yes. 

Toji:   I'm Suzuhara. 

Misato: If I'm not mistaken, did you get into the entry plug of Unit One? 

Toji:   We are very sorry for causing you so much trouble the other day. 

Toji:   Ikari-kun has been absent from the school since then, so we've
        just come to ask after his health.

Misato: Shinji-kun. He is at the training center of Nerv now. 

Toji:   I see. 

Kensuke: Here are the prints which were heaped up in his desk. 

Misato: Sorry for all the trouble. Thank you. 

Toji: Well, we'll excuse ourselves. 

Kensuke: Please say hello to Shinji-kun for us. 

Misato: Yes, I will. Bye. 

* Misato shuts the door with an affable smile floating across her face. 

Kensuke: This is an unexpected development. 

Toji: She is so beautiful, isn't she? 

* Misato gets sulky and kicks a door violently. 

Misato: Shinji damned fool! ...... jerk

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* A train is going in the heavy rain 

* Shinji is sitting on a seat of a train of the loop line and is
listening to music with SDAT walkman.

* It's early in the morning. The train is crowded with commuters. As
time goes by, the passengers get off one after another. Finally,
Shinji is alone. But Shinji remains there....... The train becomes
crowded with commuters again...... It's dark. Shinji is alone again.

Announcement: Exits on the right side at the next station. 

Announcement: Thank you very much for your taking the train of Tokyo-3
        Loop Line today. This train will be out-of-service at this
        station. Everyone, please check if you leave anything behind
        when you get off the train.

Shinji: I must go
back. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Shinji walks in an entertainment
district. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shinji is watching a movie in a theater. There are only a few people in it. 
No one watches the movie. The movie is about Second Impact in 2000.

Man A (Movie): Could you really detect that? Doctor 

(Movie): Yes. An object with a diameter of tens of millimeters crashed
        into Antarctica at tens of percent of light speed.

Man A (Movie): By our scientific knowledge, we could neither
        detect it nor prevent it. 

Woman (Movie): It's a hell on earth outside. What does the science
        exist for?! 

Man B (Movie): At present, an atomosphere flow
        caused by the earth's axis transition has decreased. 

Woman (Movie): Has it calmed down a little? 

Man B (Movie): No. A tidal wave is coming at a speed of 230 meters a second. 

Man A (Movie): Doctor, let's escape. 

Doctor (Movie): I have an obligation to stay here.

Man A (Movie): Doctor, It's easy to die. But you have an obligation to
        watch the hellish world...

* Shinji is sleeping on a sofa in the waiting room in the all-night
theater.

* He gets out of the theater and walks along the street. It's getting
light. The world has pinkish tinge. Sounds of winds are suddenly
heard. The landscape begins to move around him. He is unable to bear
them and runs with covering his eyes with his hands.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Misato lies on her back in the bed. She seems to think something. 
* Misato opens the door of Shinji's room and finds it empty. 

Misato: Jerk. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shinji gets off a bus and walks in the mountain. 
* He sits down at a cliff and looks down at Tokyo-3. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Rei lies on the bed and is examined. 
* Misato and Ritsuko are talking. 

Misato: He is just only 14 years old. In the end, it seems so severe
        for him to be burdened with the destiny of the humanity. 

Ritsuko:But we have to put piloting of Evas into the hands of
        14-year-old children.

Misato: I know. 

Ritsuko:So, was there any contact from him? 

Ritsuko:Nothing? 

Misato: Nothing. I think he won't come back again. 

Ritsuko:What are you going to do? 

Misato: Nothing special. 

Misato: If he doesn't come back, it is better for
him. 

Ritsuko:Why? 

Misato: After the last battle, 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shinji with his plug suit sits on a bench in a room of Nerv
headquarters. 

Misato: Why did you ignore my order? 

Shinji: I'm sorry. 

Misato: It's me who is responsible for the operation of you, isn't it? 
        You have an obligation to obey my orders, as you know. Do you
        understand?

Shinji: Yes. 

Misato: Make this last time. 

Shinji: Yes. 

Misato: Do you really understand what I'm saying. 

Shinji: Yes. 

Misato: Hey, it won't be all right if you answer only yes to
        everything vaguely.

Shinji: I know well, of course. That's enough, isn't that? We won anyway. 

Misato: As long as you go along with what others want ostensibly, you
        may feel comfortable. But if you continue to get into Eva with
        such a feeling, you will be killed.

Shinji: I don't mind if so. 

Misato: It would be good if I could say 'Good preparedness'. You're
        making a big mistake if you think you'll be praised by me.

Shinji: That isn't the question. Anyhow, it's only me that can get
        into it. I'll do. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ritsuko: I see. If it is only a pain for him to get into Eva, he had not
better get into it. I'm sure he will be killed. 

Ritsuko: But we need
pilots. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Kensuke Aida, Shinji's classmate, plays a survival game (Japanese English?,
playing soldiers) for himself. 

Kensuke: DaDaDaDaDaDaDaDa 

Kensuke: Captain! 


Kensuke: Aida, go ahead! 

Kensuke: I can't go without you. 

Kensuke: You fool! 

* Kensuke stops playing and finds Shinji coming. 

Kensuke: Ooph! Transferee! Ikari!

* Shinji and Kensuke are talking at a bonfire. 

Kensuke: Toji was sorry for
that. 

Kensuke:He said that he had been scolded by his younger sister. She
        said to him that it was the robot that saved our lives. It's
        shameful that he is scold by a lower grader of a primary
        school, isn't it?

Kensuke:I like night because cicadas don't make loud noises. Although
        I remember that it was quiet and I liked it, the number of
        them has been growing in the recent years.

Shinji: Misato said that the ecosystems are returning to their former
        states.

Kensuke:Hmm, Misato-san. How I envy you. You live with such a
        beautiful lady and can pilot Evangelion. Oh, I could pilot it
        to my heart's content just for once.

Shinji: You'd not better do it. I think your mother would be worried
        about it.

Kensuke:Ah, it's O.K. I don't have that. I'm the same as you.

Shinji: Yes. 

Kensuke:I don't, either. You'll take a meal, won't you?

Shinji: Do you usually do like that? 

Kensuke:Well, it sure is. 

Shinji: Is that a training for a guerrilla warfare? 

Kensuke: What can I do by toys like those? I just like doing this.

* It's early in the morning. The tent is shrouded in dense fog. Five
men with black suits appear out of the fog.

*Kensuke comes out of the tent and face one of them. They besiege the
tent.

Kensuke: OOPS! 

A man from Nerv:You are Ikari Shinji -kun, aren't you?


Shinji: Yes. 

A man from Nerv: We're from Nerv Security Intelligence. According to
        the eighth clause of the Public Security Regulations, we'll
        take you to the headquarters. OK?

Shinji: Yes. 
* Shinji goes with them. Kensuke is left alone there. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Toji and Kensuke are talking in the classroom. 

Toji: Then, were you just only seeing that?! 

Kensuke:That's easy for you to say. They were professionals of Nerv
        Security Intelligence, as I said.

Toji: So what?! I can't believe that you have testes! 

* Girls whisper. Girl 

A: Disgusting! Girl
B: Abnormal! 
Girl: Bad guy! 

Kensuke:The guy who fights is a fool when he stands no chance of
        win. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Misato opens the door and comes in the prison cell. 

Misato: Long time no see. 

Shinji: Yes. 

Misato: Did this two days' bumming around cheer you up? 

Shinji: I don't know. 

Misato: Eva is ready. You'll get into it? Or you won't? 

Shinji: You don't scold me, don't you? It's natural because you are no
        relation to me.

Shinji: If I tell you that I don't want to get into Unit One, how will
        you do with it?

Misato: I think Rei will get into it. Won't you get into it?

Shinji: It seems unrealistic that you force all off on her. 

Shinji: Don't worry. I'll get into it. 

Misato: You don't want to get into it? 

Shinji: That's natural. First of all, I'm not cut out for that.

Shinji: But Ayanami, Misato-san and Ritsuko-san 

Misato: Stop it! That has no relation with others' things! If you
        dislike, get out of here! Forget Eva and us completely, and go
        back to where you were! It's unwelcome that you get into it
        with such a feeling.

* Misato leaves the room. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Gendo, Ritsuko and Rei on a moving pavement. 

Ritsuko: Third Children is leaving Tokyo -3 tomorrow.

Gendo:  Then, we'll reconfigure the data of Unit One for
        Rei. Regardless of the restarting experience's results with
        Unit Zero, we'll start the one with Unit Zero.

Gendo:  In according to the report of Malduck organization, Fourth
        Children hasn't be found yet.

Ritsuko:You mean that we can't get recruits for the pilots.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Shinji's ID card is punched. 

Shinji: Where is Misato -san? I'd like to say good -bye.

A man of Nerv: You don't belong to Nerv now, so I can't tell you
anything at all.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Shinji gets out of the car and finds Toji and Kensuke at the
station. They have come to see him off.

Toji:   Ikari, your things left behind!

Shinji: Well, could I bother you for a second? Er -r-r-r, thank you.

Kensuke:Toji, speak! Hey! 

Toji:   Ikari, I'm sorry that I punched you twice. Hit me, please!

Shinji: I can't do that. 

Toji:   Please. Otherwise, I'm not satisfied. 

Kensuke:Well, he is an embarrassing guy like this. So, if it finally
        puts an end to the fight, how about punching him?

Shinji: But ...... 

* The men of Nerv check
their watches. 

Toji: Be quick! You have no time, don't you?

Shinji: Only one, then. 

Toji: OK. Come on! 

* Shinji tries to hit Toji but Toji stops him. 

Toji:   Stop! No allowance! 

* Shinji hits Toji. 

Kensuke:Ouchchchchch. 

Shinji: How did you know this? 

Kensuke: It was a hunch. We've seen dozens of classmates. 

Toji:   If you leave here, we'll also have to go out of this city some
        day. But we can't say anything about that. We saw you
        suffering in the Eva.

Toji:   If I find someone blames you, I'll give a good head butt! 

Toji:   Don't make such a gloomy face. 

Shinji: Well... 

* One of the men of Nerv puts his hand on Shinji's shoulder. A man of 

Nerv: Time is up. 

* Shinji begins to walk to the station. Shinji and the men of Nerv go
up the stairs to the platform. Shinji suddenly tries to come back and
says to his classmates.

Shinji: It's me that have to be hit. I'm mean, cowardly, dishonest and
        a weakling ...... A man of

Nerv:   Don't trouble us any more. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Misato and Ritsuko are talking in front of Evangelion Unit One.

Ritsuko:He's gone. Do you think this is best? 

Misato: The hedgehog's dilemma ... The nearer we come up, the more
        deeply we hurt each other...... I see.

Misato: He can't let others know his feelings in any other way of
saying. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Shinji is waiting on the platform. A train is coming. 

Announcement: An express linear train for Atsugi is coming at Track 2. 
        Be careful and step back to the inside of the area bordered
        with an yellow line.

Announcement: The train at Track 2 is a special train exclusively for
        the government. General passengers are not allowed to enter
        within the fences.

Announcement: Anyone without permission is firmly prohibited to go on
        board. 

* Misato's words come up in Shinji's mind.

Misato: Good luck. 

* The train is departing from the station.

* Misato's blue car is coming roughly. Misato gets out of the car.

Kensuke: Look! 

Toji:   That belle! 

* Misato believes that Shinji has gone and sighs deeply. And she turns
her face to the platform.......

Announcement: A local train for Gora is coming at Track 4 soon. Be
        careful and step back to inside the yellow line. If you are
        accompanied with little children, pay enough attention to
        them, please.

Announcement: The train on Track 4 is the local one which is turning
        back for Gora. If you take this train, please wait inside it.

Announcement: Attention! The train is coming soon. Please step back
        inside the yellow line.


Shinji: I'm back. 

Misato: Welcome home.

Introduction,

Neon Genesis Evangelion is the most HOT and ENTHU anime on air at the
moment in Japan. We started EVA translation project. As you know,
Wadakun completed the translation of Episode 1 to 5. He was much tired
of translating. I am the pinch hitter, and translated Episode 6 and 7.
The vocabulary and technical terms might be slightly different from
those by Wadakun. Sorry for the inconsistency.

Please translate this in your native language if your mother tongue is
not English. And then, please send us the translation.

                Avant title.

Staff:  High-energy reaction detected within target.

Misato: What the hell?!

Staff:  Radially accelerating... Converging...

Ritsuko:That means...

---------------------

Misato: No! run away!

Shinji: Waaa...

----------------------------
Misato: Retrieve it! Hurry!

----------------------------
Staff:  Target is silent.

Misato: How is Shinji-kun?

Staff:  He's alive.

Announce: Unit One scavenged. Carrying it to the 7th cage.

Misato: I'm going to the cage. Take over for me...

---------------------------------

Announce:Eva Unit One secured.

Staff:  Pilot's brain waves are erratic.
        Heart beat is very weak.

Staff:  Roger.

Staff:  Pulse recognized.

Ritsuko:Force eject the plug. Hurry!

Ritsuko:LCR emergency exhaust.

Staff:  Roger.
------------------------------
Ritsuko:Hurry, open the hatch! Hurry!

Ritsuko:Shinji-kun...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Final battle Third New Tokyo City.
                Fyenal battle therd Nu Tokyo Sitie.

                Episode 6.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Announce:Enemy's particle accelerator firing.
         Drone vapourized.

Misato: Next.

-------------------
Announce:12th type automatic mortar cannon annihilated.

Misato: Okay, I've got it!

Staff:  According to the data we've collected so far, it is presumed that 
        the enemy automatically attacks objects within a certain range.

Staff:  The particle accelerator cannon will always target and fire at 
        any object invading this area.

Staff:  Closing for combat in an Eva is too risky.

Misato: AT-field status?

Staff:  Active. A strong enough field is present to make it visible by 
        its phaseshift space.

Staff: Inductive cannon bombing or similar attacks would be about as 
        effective as throwing stones.

Misato: Both offense and defence are very slick...
         The thing's a flying fortress.
         And the enemy Shield?

Staff:  The target is just above us, penetrating the Tokyo-3 City Zero Area.
        A gigantic Shield with a diameter of 17.5 meters is heading for
        Nerv headquarters in the geofront.

Staff:  The enemy is going to attack Nerv headquarters directly...

Misato: Shit!
        And what's its ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival)?

Staff: Just past midnight, at 0:06:54, it will have breached 
       all 22 levels of defensive armour and will penetrate Nerv 
       headquarters.

Misato: Less than 10 hours left...

Announce: Enemy Shield has contacted the first defensive armour.

Misato: What's the condition of Unit One?

------------------------------------

Ritsuko:The defensive chest armour was melted up to the third layer.
        It's a good luck within a bad luck that the central control
        unit was not damaged.

Staff:  In three more seconds it would've been completely out...

Announce: Part replacement will be completed in 3 hours.

----------
Misato: Roger. Status of Unit Zero?

Staff:  No problems with restarting it, though a detectable error in
        feedback remains.

Ritsuko: So, an actual battle is--

Misato: --impossible?
        How is the pilot of Unit One?

Staff:  No physical damage.
        Nerve pulses are 0.8 higher than normal, but within acceptable 
        limits.

Announce: 9 hours, 55 minutes until the enemy's arrival.

Misato: A difficult situation...

Staff:  Do you want to show a flag of truce?

Misato: Before that, I've one itty-bitty thing left to try...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fuyutuki: Long-distance direct firing from outside the target's range?

Misato: Yes.
        A single point attack with a high energy convergence unit, without
        first neutralizing the target's AT-field.  There's no other way.

Fuyutuki:And what do the Magi say?

Misato: The answers from Supercomputer Magi were 2 affirmative and 1
        conditional affirmative.

(Misato: Two of the Magi supercomputers say it can work, while the 
        third gives a conditional affirmative.)

Fuyutuki:The probability of success is 8.7%.

Misato: That's the highest value.

Gendo:  There's no reason to reject it. Proceed, Captain Katsuagi.

Misato: Yes sir!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ritsuko:You know you've devised an insane operation, don't you, 
         Planning Manager Katsuragi?

Misato: Don't be rude! It's not insane--it can be carried out within 9 
        hours and has the highest chance of success.

Ritsuko:The plan will work?  Really?

        Special Positron Cannon for Eva.
        Cyclotron Prototype 20.

Ritsuko:Our positron rifle cannot handle that much power.
        What are you going to do?

Misato: It's been taken care of.  I'll borrow one.

Ritsuko:You'll borrow...?  You mean...?

Misato: Yeah. The SSDF (Strategic Self Defense Force) Lab's prototype.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Requisition Order

....panese government allows Special Institute Nerv (say, A)....
....o use the prototype automatic positron cannon   (say, C)....
....owned by The Strategic Self Defense Force Tech. Lab(say, D)..
....n order to carry out the present mission, requisit C ....

Misato: For this reason, we, the Special Institute Nerv, hereby requisition 
        this automatic positron cannon from 15:00 today.

Staff:  Oh, no... You might want it, but it's simply insane!

Misato: We will do our best to return this in its original condition.
        Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Misato: Okay, Rei, take this.
        It's a delicate machine, so be careful...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff:  But the power required to penetrate the AT-field is at least 
        180 GigaWatts.
        Where are you going to get that much electric power?

Misato: That's settled! From all over Japan. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
TV:    We apologize for interrupting regular programming but an 
       Emergency announcement follows. From 11:30 AM today until early 
       tomorrow morning, a large scale...

Heli:   ...electric power blackout is predicted for all of Japan.
        We kindly ask for your cooperation.

Announce: I repeat. From 11:30 AM today until early tomorrow morning,
        a large scale electric power blackout is predicted for all of Japan.
        We kindly ask for your cooperation.

Announce: Enemy Shield has broken through the 7th defensive armour.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: What is the status of the energy supply system?

Report: We are currently 3.2% behind schedule, but we will be finished
        by 23:10 today.

Misato: Positron rifle status?

Staff:  The third section of tech development is doing its best to
        assemble it within 3 hours.

Misato: And for defense?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ritsuko: Well, there's nothing to do but use a shield-armour.

Staff:  This is the shield-armour?

Ritsuko:This was a SSTO (Single Stage To Orbit) rocket.
        Its bottom armour was originally super-electromagnetically coated
        and second section assures us it can withstand the enemy's 
        particle cannon for 17 seconds.

------------------------------------------------

Misato: The attack point is...?

Staff:  Considering the position of the target, the distance, the
        geographical features, and the power supply installation,
        this point is best.

Misato: Excellent!
        All right, the attack will be from the top of Mt. Futagoyama.
        The operation will commence at 0:00 AM, midnight.
        I'm naming this "Operation Yashima."

Staff:  Roger.

---------------
Misato: The only remaining problem is the pilots.

Staff: The pilot of Unit One has returned to consciousness.
       Health readings show nothing wrong.

Misato: Okay, then the operation is going according to plan.

Staff:  Roger.

Misato: But... will he really get into Eva?

Misato: Connect to Mt. Futagoyama, hurry!

--------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: Ayanami...

Rei:    I'm here to inform you of the schedule of Operation Yashima. 
        It will begin at 0:00 AM, midnight.
        The two pilots, Ikari and Ayanami, will scramble at the cage at 17:30
        today.
        At 18:00 PM, ready Units One and Zero.
        At 18:05 PM, launch.
        At 18:30 PM, arrive at the Emergency Base on Mt. Futagoyama.
        Wait there for further instructions.
        When the day changes, the operation starts.

Rei:    Here is the new one. 

Rei:    Don't come with that appearance with sleepy head.

Shinji: Oh, sorry!
        I've been apologizing a lot since yesterday...

Rei:    Meal.

Shinji: I don't want to eat.

Rei:    We will depart in 60 minutes.

Shinji: Do I really have to get into Eva again?

Rei:    Yes, you do.

Shinji: Your words can be so cold because you've never experienced
        horrible things in it.  I never want to experience such things 
        again...

Rei:    Then stay in bed.

Shinji: In bed?

Rei:    I will get into Unit One.
        Dr. Akagi is ready to rewrite the personal data in Unit One.

Shinji: Ritsuko-san is...?

Rei:    I'm leaving. Captain Katsuragi and Dr. Akagi are waiting for me.

Shinji: Oh...

Rei:    Good bye.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Touji:  I'm tired of waiting. It's time to go to the shelter.

Kensuke:I secretly read my father's data.
        There's no doubt about the time.

Touji:  But they haven't appeared!

All:    Oh!

Touji:  That mountain is moving...

Kensuke: There they are! Evangelions!

All:    WOW!

All:    Great!

All:    Hang in there, Evangelions! We believe in you!

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Announce: Enemy Shield has broken through the 17th defensive armour.
        3 hours, 55 minutes until its arrival at the head office.

Announce: Electric power supply from Shikoku and Kyushu Aria complete.

Announce: Starting tests of each cooling system.

Ritsuko:This is precision machine. Be careful.

Shinji: This was not meant for field battle. Will it really work?

Ritsuko:There's no other way. This is an emergency use.

Shinji: Will everything be okay?

Ritsuko:Theoretically, yes.
        However, I don't know if the accelerator and cannon will withstand 
        the blast. It's the first time firing with so much power.

Misato: Here are the arrangements for the operation.
        Shinji-kun--

Shinji: Yes.

Misato: You will be the gunner.
        Rei, you will defend him with Unit Zero.

Rei:    Yes.

Ritsuko:This arrangement is due to the fact that Shinji's synchronization
        ratio is higher and we need more precise operation this time.
        Since the positron beam is influenced by the magnetic field,
        gravity field and the revolution of the Earth, it will not fire in 
        a straight line. Don't forget to adjust for that error--you must 
        hit the core precisely.

Shinji: But I've never practiced!

Ritsuko: Don't worry, it's just like in the textbook.
        When the marks get together in the middle, fire.
        The computers will do the rest automatically.
        For a second shot, you will have to wait a little while to 
        replace fuses, cool down, and reload the rifle.

Shinji: And if I miss and the enemy shoots at us?

Ritsuko:Don't think like that.
        You must hit and destroy it with one shot.

Shinji: We're in a tight pinch...

Rei:    I... I will protect Unit One.

Ritsuko: Yes.

Rei:    I understand.

Misato: It's time. You two change clothes.

Two:    Yes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: We may die...

Rei:    Why do you say that?

Rei:    You won't die... I will protect you.

----------------------------------------

Shinji: Why are you doing this?

Rei:    Because it's my bond.

Shinji: Bonds?

Rei:    Yes, bonds.

Shinji: Bonds to my father?

Rei:    To all people.

Shinji: You are strong, Ayanami.

Rei:    I have nothing else.

Shinji: You have nothing else...?
        
Rei:    It's time.
        Here we go.
        Good bye...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Announce: It is now midnight.

Staff:  The operation starts.

Misato: Shinji-kun, you're using energy from all over Japan.
        Hang in there!

Shinji: Yes.

Misato: Start first connection.

Staff:  From first through 80th tank, start power supply.

Announce: Voltage up. Powering up the water exchange unit.

Staff:  All cooling systems at full power.

Announce: Temperature stable. No problem.

Staff:  Positron charge is nominal.

Misato: Second connection.

Staff:  Start all accelerators.

Staff:  Start converger.

Announce: All power supplies to the submission station on Mt. Futagoyama.
          No problem.

Misato: Release all final safety systems.

Staff:  pull sear up.

Announce: Adjustment for the gravity field and revolution of the Earth is
        minus 0.0009.
        0.2 to the critical voltage.

Staff:  7th, 10th connection.

Announce: All energy to the positron rifle.

Staff:  8, 7, 6...

Staff:  High energy reaction detected in the target.

Ritsuko:What?!

Staff:  3, 2, 1...

Misato: Fire!

Ritsuko: Oh, no!

Misato: We failed?

Announce: Enemy Shield has penetrated the Geofront.

Misato: Hurry for a second shot.

Staff:  Exchanging fuses. Recharging.

Staff:  Cooling of the rifle has started.
        Another high energy reaction detected in the target.

Misato: This is bad!

Misato: Shinji-kun--

Shinji: Ayanami!

Ritsuko:The shield cannot hold for...!

Misato: Ready yet?

Staff:  10 more seconds!

Shinji: Hurry!

Misato: Okay!

Shinji: Ayanami!

Shinji: WOWOWOW

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shinji: Ayanami, are you all right? Ayanami!
        Don't say "I have nothing else."
        Don't say "good bye" when we launch--it's too sad.

Rei:    Why are you crying?
        I'm sorry.

Rei:    I'm sorry. I don't know what to feel at times like this...

Shinji: I think you should smile...

End of Episode 6

Gendo:  I owe you once again.

Tel:   But you won't make up for it, right?
        As for the material they requested under the authority of the 
        information publicity control, I provided them with false
        information.
        The administration's preparation of the legal act will soon be 
        dimissed.  And what about that?  Should I do something in case that 
        happens?

Gendo:  No need to. The material from you does not suggest any 
        problems.

Tel:    All right, then, I'll continue with the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------
PenPen: WOW?

Shinji: Good... morning.

Misato: Well, G'mornin'...

Misato: WOW! HO!! THIS is how a morning starts!

Shinji: No coffee?

Misato: A Japanese style morning always begins with steamed rice,
        miso-soup, and sake! It's been tradition for many years...

Shinji: Misato-san's tradition, anyway...

Misato: What do you mean?

Shinji: Remember who's on duty for breakfast this morning?

Misato: Oops.

Shinji: Now I know why at your age you're still single.

Misato: I apologize for my coarse manners...

Shinji: And you're lazy, aren't you?

Misato: Quiet!

Shinji: I'm finished. Are you really coming to school today?

Misato: Yes, of course--there's your parent-teacher career meeting.

Shinji: But you're so busy...

Misato: Don't worry about that. It's my responsibility.

Shinji: Responsibility?

Misato: Oh!

Misato: Hey, thanks for coming. Hold on a minute...

Shinji: Don't meet them looking like that. It's shameful.

Misato: No, no.

Two:    G'morning, Ikari-kun! Hi, Misato-san. We're off!

Misato: Good luck!

Two:    WOW!

Shinji: Go ahead!

Misato: Well, ironic... Okay, so now he feels at home, and can express
        himself more than before.

Tel:    Hello?

Misato: He just left. Secret service please!
---------------------------------------

Touji:  Wow, she's beautiful.

Students: Cool woman! Who was that?

Students: Ikari's guardian.

Students: You mean he lives with someone that gorgeous?!

Chairgirl: They're fools.

Touji:  Oh, Misato-san's nice!  Very nice!

Shinji: I don't think so.

Touji:  She's also the Planning Manager! It's great!

Shinji: I don't think so...

Touji:  Aren't we lucky, Kensuke, that Shinji is such a baby?
        He's certainly no competition for us.

GirlStudents: My mother is decorating a lot for the discussion of
        post-graduate life. She's so silly!

Kensuke: Yeah, they are definitely not in the running.

Shinji: Touji and the guys don't know her coarse manners...

Touji:  A girl like that could be my girlfriend!

Shinji: You would have a hard time...

Two:    You don't know that, master.  Okay, you guard the Earth and 
        peace, and we'll guard Misato-san!

Shinji: Hmm...

-----------------------------------------------------------

Announce: Unit One has cleared the critical temperature. Move to the
        second stage.

Shinji: The Earth and peace. I use Eva for the sake of those. What's Eva?
        An entry plug which smells of blood and somehow calms me.
        Nothing.  Nothing I know.

-------------------
Ritsuko: How are Eva Zero's bio-chest components?

Staff:  Completely destroyed. We're going to have to rebuild them. 
        However, the supplementary budget for that is at critical.

Ritsuko: I hope this gets easier after Eva Two arrives.

Staff:  It might get worse.
        Disposing of the Angels' corpses costs a lot, right?

Misato: Yeah. And we should complain about the budget--humanity's 
        destiny rests on this system.

Ritsuko:You're wrong. Humanity needs more than Eva. In order for those 
        survivers to live, money is necessary.

Misato: Budget... Okay! Anyway, the commander is at the conference?

Ritsuko:Yes. He's currently flying there.

Staff:  It's so quiet when he's gone...

--------------------------------------
A Man:  Excuse me... Do you mind if I sit here?
        The draft amendment to the budget for the collecting samples
        has gone through.

Gendo:  The Commitee thinks their survival is the highest priority so
        they'd agree to any budget to keep their skins whole.
        They'll pay any amount to continue living.

A Man:  They thought Angels would never appear again...
        And there's more good news--except for the States, all member 
        countries of the council have approved the budget for Eva Unit 
        Six and it's only a matter of time until the States approves it 
        as well. That country's problem is an allergy to unemployment...

Gendo:  And what of your country?

A Man:  We will participate in the construction plan from Unit Eight 
        onward.  The plan for the second installation is still valid.
        However... the problem remains that the pilot has not yet been found.

Gendo:  Angels have come again. We have no choice but to defeat them.

A Man:  We don't want another Second Impact.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shinji: So, you're saying the Second Impact that vapourized Antarctica 
        was...

Ritsuko: Well, in the history texts, it is explained as a disaster caused 
         by a massive meteoric collision. However, it is usually the case 
         that the true facts are consealed. 15 years ago, mankind found the 
         first humanoid creature, called an Angel, in Antarctica.
         In the middle of the investigation, for some unknown reason it 
         exploded, and that's the actual incident known as the Second Impact.

Shinji:  Then, the things we're doing are...

Ritsuko: To avoid a probable Third Impact.
         That's the reason for Nerv and the Evangelions. 
         By the way, the event will be held tomorrow.

Misato: All right.

------------------------------------------------------
PenPen: Puwa!

Misato: G'morning!

Shinji: Good morning.

Misato: I'm going to Ex-Tokyo on business. I'll be back late.
        You should eat out tonight.

Shinji: Well... okay.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: Hard to imagine that this was the flourishing metropolis of Tokyo.

Ritsuko:Here, we've arrived.

Misato: There's no reason to do that here. And the SSDF has something 
        to do with this project?

Ritsuko:You mean the Strategic Self-Defense force? No, no interference 
        is allowed.

Misato: That may be the reason why they do as they like.

------------------------

Chair:  Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this exhibition by
        Nippon Heavy Industry Solidarity. You will be observing the official
        demonstration from the control room. Are there any questions?

Ritsuko: Yes!

Chair:  Ah, the famous Dr. Akagi Ritsuko! I am very glad to see you here.

Ritsuko:May I ask a question?

Chair:  Absolutely, yes!

Ritsuko:According to the explanation, the unit is equipped with
        an internal combustion engine.

Chair:  Yes. It's a big feature of this unit--continuous operation for
        150 days is assured.

Ritsuko:But looking at it from a safety perspective, you risk too much
        using an internal reactor in a land-battle weapon.

Chair:  It's more useful than a weapon which lasts less than 5 minutes 
        without its power cord.

Ritsuko:But there would be problems with remote-control in an emergency
        situation.

Chair:  Our system is more humane--it doesn't cause mental illness 
        in pilots simply from the stress.

Misato: Stop! This is childish.

Ritsuko:Your human interface system also has problems.

Chair:  It's safer than your system--yours can allow a dangerous weapon to 
        go wild. A weapon without control is insane. It's like a woman in 
        hysterics--nobody can deal with one.

Ritsuko:Our technology and pilots are ready for such a situation.

Chair:  Do you really think that science and the human mind are able to
        control those monsters? Are you serious?

Ritsuko:Yes, I am absolutely serious.

Chair:  Because you trust such unreliable minds, Nerv allowed that 
        loss of control to happen. As the result, the United Nations was 
        forced to supplement your already huge budget. Do you know that 
        there are more than 20 thousand starving people in some countries? 
        The cause of that incident is still under investigation--you're 
        lucky you're protected by a super-legal act.

Ritsuko:Say anything you want, but except for Nerv's primary weapon,
        nothing can defeat those enemies.

Chair:  You mean the AT-field? That's only a matter of time.
        Nerv's epoch will not last forever.

---------------------------------------------------

Misato: Eh, this is total bullshit.  Those bastards are...
        Maybe this is revenge from those who failed to get Nerv's 
        acquisitions. This is pissing me off! Those guys...! Phew...

Misato: Stop! It's childish. So proud of himself, wanting to be
        appreciated... He's not worthy of the attention.

Misato: But how did those guys know about the AT-field?

Ritsuko: The top secrets are leaking badly.

Misato: What's the intelligence section doing?

------------------------------------------------------------

Chair:  We're about to start the demonstration of the JA. There's nothing to
        worry about. No danger at all. Please watch from that window there.

Staff:  Ready to start.

Chair:  Start the test!

Staff:  Release all engine units.

Staff:  Pressure is regular.

Staff:  Circulation in the cooling system, no problem.

Staff:  Control rods, full release.

Staff:  Engine going through critical point.

Staff:  Power, no problem.

Chair:  Start walking.

Staff:  Walk. Move ahead slowly. Raise right foot ahead.

Staff:  Roger. Walk. Move ahead slowly. Raise right foot ahead.

Staff:  Balance is nominal.

Staff:  Engine is nominal.

Staff:  Roger. Next stage. Raise left foot ahead.

Staff:  Go ahead.

Misato: Ah, walking normally. That's something to be proud of.

Chair:  What's wrong?

Staff:  Strange! The reactor pressure is increasing!

Staff:  The temperature of the first level cooling liquid is also 
        rising.

Chair:  Open the release valve! Pump in the neutron-deceleration
        liquid!

Staff:  Negative! The pumps are not responding.

Chair:  Oh, no! Stop power. Emergency halt!

Staff:  Transmission of the halt signal verified.

Staff:  It was not accepted.

Staff:  The wireless connection no carry.

Staff:  It's out of control!

Chair:  What the hell!
-------------------------

Spectators: Flee! Run away! WOW!
----------------------

Misato: cough, cough...

Ritsuko:cough, cough...

Misato: The robot's as rude as the man who built it!

-------------------------------

Staff:  Compression value is irregular.

Staff:  Control rods are non-operational.

Staff:  There is a danger of meltdown.

Chair:  Uh, uh, unbelievable! JA has a fault tolerant system
        programmed for all possible emergencies. This can't happen!
--------------------

Misato: We now have to confront the possibility of meltdown.

Chair:  In the present circumstances, there's nothing to do but to 
        wait for a self-halt.

Misato: How likely is a self-halt?

Staff:  0.00002%. It would be a miracle!

Staff:  We'd better do something other than wait for that miracle.
        Tell me how to stop it.

Chair:  We've tried all possible ways to halt it.

Misato: No. There must be a way to reset everything--the ultimate method
        of stopping it. Give me the password to do that.

Chair:  The password to delete all programming is top-secret. I am not 
        responsible for it. I haven't the clearance to tell you. 

Misato: Then get clearance! Immediately! 

Chair:  Well, it's me. Connect me to Mr. Manda at Second Tokyo. Yes. 
        Minister of the Interior. 

-----------------------------

Manda:  Oh, concerning that matter, Mr. Yasugi will deal with that. 
        Call him! 

------------------------------- 

Yasugi: That's too serious a matter to authorize by vocal order. You need 
        an official diploma. 
-------------------------------- 

Chair:  Then we ask the permission for Mr. Yoshizawa? What? Yes. I've 
        received the permission from Mr. Uitsu. Yes. Alright. Uh huh. 
        Then good bye.

Misato: Hot potato situation?

Chair:  We'll receive clearance soon. The operation will be authorized.

Misato: We can't wait that long! After the explosion, it will be 
        too late!

Staff:  Jet Aalon is heading for Atsugi.

Misato: No time! I'll do of my own accord. Excuse me.

Misato: Hey, Hyuga-kun? People in Atsugi know what I am going to do.
        Send Shinji-kun and Unit One with F equipment here...
        Yes, it's an emergency.

Ritsuko:Impossible! Stop that, Captain Katsuragi? How are you going 
        to stop that?

Misato: By human hand, directly.

Chair:  Are you serious?

Misato: Yes.

Chair:  But the interior will be radioactive. It's too dangerous.

Misato: It's the only chance to save everyone.

Staff:  When this control signal is off, you can open the hatch 
        manually.

Staff:  You can enter through the back-pack.

Chair:  KIBOU ("Hope")... That's the password to delete the programming.

Misato: Thanks.

Misato: The target is JA. There's a danger of meltdown in 5 minutes.
        We cannot allow that in a populated area. Hyouga-kun?

Hyuga:  Yes?

Misato: After launching Eva, escape quickly. Ascend to a safe level.

Hyuga: Roger!

Misato: Shinji-kun--

Shinji: Yes.

Misato: Run with the target, and then put me on the back.
        Then hold the target motionless.

Shinji: You're riding on that, Misato-san?

Misato: Yes.

Shinji: That's ridiculous!

Misato: I know it's ridiculous, but there's no other way!

Shinji: It's too dangerous!

Misato: Don't worry. Eva can withstand a possible direct explosion.

Shinji: I don't mean that! I mean Misato-san's....

Misato: Well, I have to do what I can. Otherwise, I'll regret it 
        forever.

Shinji: Uhhh.
-------------------------

Hyuuga: Target in sight.

Misato: Here we go!

Hyuga:  Eva at the drop position.

Misato: Docking release!

Shinji: Roger!

Shinji: I've caught up!

Misato: Less than 4 minutes left. Put me on that!

Shinji: Oh, no.

Misato: Don't care. DO!

Shinji: OH!

Misato: WOW!

Shinji: Misato-san, take care!
-----------------------

Misato: Burning hot! This's dangerous.

Shinji: Stop! Stop! this guy!

Shinji: Misato-san, hurry!

Misato: Here it is.

Misato: Error? Why?

Misato: No doubt. The program has been replaced.

Shinji: OH!

Staff:  Power reactor, 0.2 to the critical point.

Staff:  Control rods are non-operational.

Misato: It's... a long shot.

Misato: u....

Shinji: Misato-san, escape!

Misato: Move! Move! this guy!

Shinji: Misato-san--

Misato: uu....

Staff:  0.1 to the critical point!

Staff:  OH NO! It's gonna explode!

Chair:  It's over...?

Shinji: MISATO-SAN!

Misato: u.... haa...

Shinji: Phew!

----------------------

Staff:  Done it!

Staff:  Interior pressure dropping.

Staff:  All readings nominal.

All:    WOW! Saved! Done it! Done it!

Ritsuko:That fool woman!

Shinji: Misato-san, are you all right? Misato-san?

--------------

Misato: Well, yes, though somewhat worse for wear.

Shinji: I'm glad! You are alive! I'm glad to hear that!
        You're great! You're so wonderful! A miracle happened!

Misato: Yes... The miracle was granted... by somebody...

--------------------------------------

Ritsuko:Unit One retrieval complete. No fear of radioactivity.
        Except for Captain Katsuragi's operation, everything was done
        according to the plan.

Gendo:  You've done it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PenPen: Uki?

Misato  Huuu. G'mornin'! (drinking) phew! WOW!
        Now, for a shower... Where's a bra? ...and pants?

Two.    G'morning, Ikari-kun!

Shinji: G'morning! I'm off!

Misato: Good luck!

--------------
Touji:  Phew, Misato-san is so nice!

Shinji: I thought so, but she's lazy, coarse, bad looking, and 
        anything but nice at home. It's shameful for me to see her.

Kensuke: I really envy you!

Shinji: What for?

Kensuke: Ikari really is just a kid!

Touji:  Yeah!

Shinji: How come?

Kensuke: She lets you see sides of her that she doesn't let us to see.
        That means she and you are family.

Shinji: Well...

Gendou: Yes, I've already made arrangements with the Committee about
        that problem. The cargo left port at Sasebo yesterday, and is now
        on the Pacific.

Kensuke:A MIG 55D transport helicopter! I never thought I'd get a
chance to fly on one! It's great to have friends, isn't it, Shinji?

Shinji: Eh?

Misato: I think it's stuffy being in the same mountain day after day,
so I asked all of you out on this date.

Touji:  Eh! Then this is a real date with Misato-san?
        Misato-san, I bought this cap just for today.

Shinji: So, where are we headed?

Misato: We're cruising the Pacific ocean on that gorgeous ship!

Kensuke:Wow! 5 carriers and 4 battleships! A cool fleet! Yeah, it's
        good to have friends...

Touji:  That ship's "gorgeous"?

Kensuke:You bet it's gorgeous!
        That's the regular carrier "Over the Rainbow," the pride of
        the U.N. forces.

Shinji: The ship is huge!

Misato: I wonder why such a relic is still afloat?

Kensuke:No, no, it's just vintage, pre-Second Impact.

Captain: Hell!  How easygoing can she be, bringing a socket for the
kids' toy, so the kids can play!

Kensuke: Wow! Great, great, great...! Too great! If you're a man, you
        have to weep at such a sight! Great...!

Touji:  Hey, wait! Wait! Damn it, stop! Stop!

Asuka:  Hello, Misato. How are you?

Misato: As well as ever. You've grown tall, haven't you?

Asuka:  Yeah! And not just taller--my figure has filled out, too.

Misato: Let me introduce you--this is the exclusive pilot of
Evangelion Unit Two, the Second Child, Soryu Asuka Langley.

-----------------------

Touji:  What did you hit me for?!

Asuka:  Payment for the view. You don't think it's cheap?

Touji:  Huh? Then I'll show you the same thing!

Asuka:  What are you doing!

Asuka:  So, which is the much-discussed Third Child?
        Don't tell me it's THAT boy?

Misato: No, this one.

Asuka:  Hmm... He seems rather dull...

Captain:Ah, I thought you were the leader of these kids, but now I
        see that I was wrong...

Misato: Thank you for understanding, Captain.

Captain:Ah, no, no. Thank _you_ for bringing me even more children to
        take care of after so long a time.

Misato:We appreciate your assistance with the marine transport of Eva
Two. Here are the specifications for the emergency power socket.

Captain:Ha! I'd never allow a request to run that doll on the sea in
        the first place!

Misato: Just think of it as a fall back in case of emergency.

Captain:It's against such emergencies that the Pacific fleet is
supposed to guard! When did the U.N. turn us into bloody cargo haulers?

First Officer:I believe it was just after a certain organization was
        established.

Captain:Guarding a toy! What a grand assignment for the entire Pacific
        fleet!

Misato: Considering Eva's importance, it still seems lacking.
        Well, please sign these forms.

Captain:Not yet. At the request of the 3rd Branch in Germany, both Eva
        Two and its pilot are under the command of this fleet. I won't
        allow you to just do as you please!

Misato: Then when will you relinquish command?

First Officer:After unloading the cargo at Shin-Yokosuka.

Captain:We're in charge of anything on the sea. Follow orders without
        question.

Misato: Yes, I understand. In an emergency, however, please don't
forget that Nerv's authority exceeds yours.

Touji:  She's cool!

Shinji: She looks like Ritsuko-san...

Ryouji: You're as gallant as always...

Asuka:  Kaji-senpai!

Captain: Kaji-kun! I insist that you not invite yourself to the
bridge!

Ryouji: Sorry about that.

Misato: Then excuse us. In way to Shin-Yokosuka...(??)

* I don't know what Misato means by "In way to..." or even who she says 
* it too.  Perhaps, "On your way to..." but I don't know.

Touji:  Wasn't this a date?

Captain:Shit! Those kids will save the Earth?

First Officer:Times change. I heard the Assembly has put their hopes
on that robot.

Captain:On that toy? Idiots! If they have the money to pay for that,
       they should be paying us more!

Misato: What are you doing here?!

Ryouji: Accompanying her. I'm on a business trip from Germany.

Misato: I'm getting careless... I should have expected this
situation...

Misato,Asuka:Hey, don't push!

Ryouji,Touji:We can't help it!

Announcement: Squadron 3, take off as scheduled. Squadron 7, on duty
to second deck...

Ryouji: Are you seeing anyone?

Misato: And when did that become any of you business?

Ryouji: Oh, you wound me... Are you living with Katsuragi?

Shinji: Umm, yes.

Ryouji: Tell me, is she still so wild in bed?

Misato: Wh-- wh-- what are you implying!

Ryouji: She hasn't changed, Ikari Shinji-kun?

Shinji: Um, yes. Ah, how do you know my name?

Ryouji: It's no wonder I know you. You're famous in my circle--the
Third Child who used Eva in combat without training.

Shinji: I got lucky.

Ryouji: That luck is a part of your destiny--it's your talent.
        Well, see you later.

Shinji: Okay.

Misato: This has to be a bad joke. No, a nightmare...

Ryouji: What do you think about Ikari Shinji-kun?

Asuka:  He's dull! That's the great Third Child? I'm disappointed!

Ryouji: But without training, in actual combat his synchro-rate still
        easily exceeds 40%.

Asuka: That can't be true! It's unbelievable! Don't lie to me! A lie!

Touji:  That captain was completely arrogant!

Misato: He's a proud man. He can't help but be cynical toward us.

Shinji: He seems to be rather lively... Kaji-san, I mean.

Misato: He's always been like that, the iiidiot!

Asuka:  Third Child!

Asuka:  Come with me.

Shinji: Hmm, Unit Two is red. I didn't expect that.

Asuka:  That's not the only difference. After all, Units Zero and One 
        are prototypes, test models in the development process. The fact
        that it synchronized with you, an untrained boy, is good proof
        of that. However, Unit Two is not the same. This is a true
        Evangelion, the first on Earth built for actual combat, the
        final model.

Shinji: Ah, what's happening?

Asuka:  Shock wave in the water...! Something exploded nearby.

Shinji: What's that...?! Is that... an Angel?

Asuka:  Is that a real...?

Shinji: What do I do? I've got to get back to Misato-san.

Asuka:  Now's my chance!

Announcement:All ships, check distances between other ships,
        and avoid motion.

First Officer:Report!

Voice:  (???), sinking. Titus Andronicus, still can't confirm the
target!

* (???) here's the name of a ship.

Captain:Damn it! What's going on?!

Misato: Hi, Nerv Delivery!  You ordered data on and countermeasures
        against this invisible enemy, right?

Captain:In battle! Authorized personnel only!

Misato: From what I can tell, this must be an Angel attack.

Captain:All ships, fire at will.

Misato: That's useless.

Touji:  That kind of attack won't penetrate its AT-Field.

Misato: Funny! Why's the Angel here? Did it come for Unit Two?

Shinji: Hey, where are we going?

Asuka:  Wait here a second.

Shinji: What's she doing...?

Asuka:  Don't peep, you jerk!
        Why are boys such perverted idiots!

Asuka:  Asuka, let's go.

Captain:Why won't it sink?

Touji:  I knew it--only Eva can beat it.

Asuka:  Hey, let's go!

Shinji: Eh?

Asuka:  Come with me!

Shinji: Hey, why are we changing into plug suits?

Asuka:  Are you stupid? I want to beat it with my Unit Two.

Shinji: That's going too far. What about Misato-san's permission?

Asuka:  I'll get permission after I win.

Asuka:  Here I go--now you'll see how skillful my piloting is.
        Just don't disturb me.

Misato: Curious... It seems to be looking for something.

Ryouji: I never expected an Angel attack here. This isn't like you
said it would be.

Gendou: Unit Two is just for this case, and I added a second pilot
        as a reserve. If the worst happens, escape by yourself.

Ryouji: I know.

Asuka:  Erst Erfu"llung, Anfang der Bewegung, Anfang des
Nervenanschlusses, Also lo"se sie es von links kleidung, Single start!

* German, but I don't know what it means, or even if it's spelled right.

Shinji: An error? What happened?

Asuka:  Thought noise. I told you not to disturb me.

Shinji: What do you mean?

Asuka:  You think in Japanese, right? Just think in German.

Shinji: All right... Ba-- baumkuuhen...

Asuka:  Idiot! Fine, stop trying. Switch the base thought language to
        Japanese.

Asuka:  Evangelion Unit Two, start!

Voice:  Message received from Othero: Evangelion Unit Two is starting.

Misato: Good, Asuka!

Captain:No, halt the start sequence. Reset it!

Misato: I don't care! Asuka, launch!

Captain:What!? Both Eva Two and its pilot are under our control.
        I won't relinquish command to you!

Misato:What are you talking about? This is an emergency!
       Your orders don't matter!

First Officer:You aren't serious? Unit Two is still carrying
B-equipment.

Shinji: If this falls into the sea, it's over.

Asuka:  And if it doesn't fall, we're okay!

Misato: Shinji-kun, are you there?

Shinji: Yes.

Captain:Kids! Two kids...

Misato: Can I examine...

Misato: Asuka, take off!

Shinji: We're coming!

Asuka:  I'm going!

Asuka:  Where?

Shinji: That direction! Only 58 seconds left.

Asuka:  I know! Misato, prepare the emergency power socket on the
deck.

Misato: I understand.

Captain:What are you doing?

Asuka:  Here we go! Jump!

Shinji: Jump?!

Deck Officers:Run!

Voice(male):Spare socket ready.

Voice(female):Reactor connection complete.

Announcement:Clear the flight deck.

Announcement:Prepare to receive Eva.

First Officer:All personnel, brace for impact.

Captain:Nonsense!

Asuka:  Eva Unit Two, landiiing!

Kensuke:What a waste!

Voice:  Target is rapidly approaching this ship!

Shinji: It's coming from 9 o'clock!

Asuka:  Transfer to the external power source completed.

Shinji: But we have no firearms.

Asuka:  The Prog-knife can deal with it.

Shinji: The thing's damn big!

Asuka:  That's what I thought.

Captain:What will you do?

Misato: Close range combat is the best way to defeat Angels.

Misato: Asuka, you did it!

Captain:This isn't a JOKE! The flight deck sustained heavy damage.

Captain:It's sinking!

Misato: Asuka, underwater battle is impossible with B-equipment.

Asuka:  You don't know until you try...

Kensuke:What a waste...

Misato: Cable length?

First Officer:1,200 remaining.

Captain:What will you do?

Misato: We can deal with it.

Shinji: We must deal with it.

Misato: Out of cable. Brace for shock.

Asuka:  Damn it!

Voice:  Eva missed the target.

Kensuke:Change disks...

Kensuke:Ah....! Forge 38!

Ryouji: Hey, Katsuragi!

Misato: Kaji!

Ryouji: I've something to deliver, so I'll be leaving now...

Ryouji: Take off!

Ryouji: So, if you'll excuse me, Captain Katsuragi...

Touji:  He ran away.  He escaped...

Voice:  Target again approaching Eva!

Shinji: It's coming again!

Asuka:  I'll beat it this time!

Asuka:  What?! It's not working!

Shinji: With B-equipment...

Asuka:  What can we do?

Shinji: What can we do?!

Asuka:  How sloppy! You're the Third Child, aren't you?

Shinji: Here it comes!

Asuka:  M-- mouth?

Shinji: 'Cause it's an _Angel_...

Voice:  Eva Unit Two has entered target's body.

Touji:  Does that mean Eva was eaten?!

Touji:  Just like fishing...

Misato: Fishing...? Yes, fishing!

Shinji: Well, we're in another tight spot.

Asuka:  Shut up... Hey, get off me, jerk!

Shinji: But we have to free ourselves!

Misato: Asuka, can you hear me? Don't release it!

Misato: Captain.

Captain:What?

Misato: I beg your cooperation.

Captain:Point blank shooting by the remaining two battleships?

Misato: Yes. We evacuate two battleships and sink them on the axial 
        line of the Umbilical Cable to form a trap.
        Meanwhile, Eva Unit Two will open the mouth of the target. The
        ships will then rush into the opening, fire with their bow
        turrets, and then self-destruct. That way the target will be
        totally defeated.

Captain:That's absurd!

Misato: Absurd but possible.

Captain:I understand.

Announcement:All personnel, abandon ship.  Repeat, all personnel
abandon ship.  Each section to the lifeboats.

Captain:But what about Eva?

Misato: Don't worry about those two.

Asuka:  Hey, don't operate Unit Two without my permission!

Misato: Do you two understand the operation?

Shinji: I'll do my best.

Misato: I'm counting on you.

Voice:  All ships, open the Kingston valve. Start sinking to Z-point.

Misato: Cable, reverse!

Voice:  Eva has started surfacing. 70 to contact.

Asuka:  Hey, you're still touching my... Move!

Shinji: But if we can't open the mouth soon, we'll be destroyed, too.

Voice:  60 to contact.

Misato: Status of Angel's mouth?

Captain:Still closed.

Voice(female):Two battleships sinking to the target.

Voice(male):Eva surfacing. 50 to contact.

Shinji: No!

Asuka:  No time...

Voice(female):Target passed the bottom of Tempest.

Misato: Hurry or you'll be too late!

Asuka:  Don't think strange things!

Shinji: What?

Asuka:  Never mind, just concentrate.

Shinji: I know.

Voice:  20 to contact.

Voice:  15 to contact.

Shinji,Asuka:Open, open, open, open!

Misato: Fire!

Sign:   Shin Yokosuka (AKA Odawara, pre-S.I.)

Ritsuko:That was some show!

Misato: I had to improvise the underwater combat.

Ritsuko:It's rare to hear you say that. Is this self-examination?

Misato: Don't say it. We collected precious data.

Ritsuko:Misato...

Misato: Hmm...?

Ritsuko:It truly is precious.

Touji:  P... Pair--look!

Kensuke:I feel sick!

Ritsuko:They boosted their synchronization values, didn't they?

Misato: In only 7 seconds. It may have been due to the danger...

Asuka:  Hey, where's Kaji-san?

Misato: He escaped earlier and must already have arrived at HQ.
        That bastard!

Ryouji: Well, that was an eventful journey!
        Was it caused by this, I wonder?

Ryouji: It has already been restored to this.
        Being held with the durbakerite, though, I'm certain it's
        still alive.

Ryouji: That is the point of the Instrumental Project of Mankind,
        isn't it?

Gendou: Yes. This is the first human being, ADAM.

Touji:  Really, she was a disgusting girl, despite her lovely
appearance.

Kensuke:Well, we'll never see her again.

Touji:  But, Sensei, you can't avoid meeting her because of your job.
        I really pity you.

Asuka:  Greetings. I am Souryuu Asuka Langley.

        It's I that is saying hello to you.

        You must be glad at that. 

        And here must be one more ..

Shinji: who?

Asuka:  You silly boy!

        I mean nothing but first children.

     # Gainax uses First/Second/third children, not first/second/third

Asuka:  'Coz it's convenient for various purpose.

Rei:    If ordered, I will do.

Asuka:  Funny guy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ritsuko: hmm??

Ritsuko: You've got slenderer?

Ritsuko: Is that so?

Ryouji: You are in a sad love.

Ritsuko: How come you know that?

Ryouji: 'Coz those who have a mole on the tear way are destined to

        live a life with full of tears.

Ritsuko: are you going to seduce me?

        But I don't accept you. Horrible lady is looking at us.

Misato: uuuuuuuuu.

Ristuko: Long time no see Kanji-kun.

Ryouji: Well, Long time no see.

Ritsuko: But, you are sillier than I expected.

Misato: He's long since been silly.

        Your business to bring here Unit 2 is complete.

        You must go home!

Ryouji: I received an official announcement of transfer this day morning.

        I must stay here. I'm lucky that we can do as we used to do.

T        EP

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: The intercept system of Third New Tokyo city was heavily damaged

        by the privious battle. Only 26% has been restored.

        Operatable equipment at the actual battle is almost Zero.

        Thus, we beat the target before that land at the waterfront.

        Unit 1 and Unit 2 countinal attack in turn.

        Close battle!

Shinji&Asuka: Roger!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka: Although this is my first battle for debut in Japan,

        How come I ain't allowed to battle alone.

Shinji: No way. That's the operation.

Asuka:  I say to you now! Don't do nothing that disturb me.

Shinji: No.

Asuka:  How come you were selected to a pilot?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  It's no fighter's manner to attack by two. 

        It's no my preference.

Misato: We don't have reserved to choose the way, to survive!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: Oh, coming!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: Start attack!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  OK, here I go! Support me!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: Oh, I support you?

Asuka:  That's lady-first!

Shinji: dumn it! New comer should not lead me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  I've got it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: Oh !

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: Oh no!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: GOOD JOB!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  Did you see, third children!

        Battle must always be elegant without waste.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: Oh!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  What?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: That's unfair!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Maya:   10:58:15 a.m. today.

        Unit 1 attacked by one of the target separated into two, say A,

        sank at the place 2 kilometer from Surugawan bay.

        10:58:20 a.m. Unit two stopped action after the attack by the other

        target, say B.

        The comments of the people who are responsible of the operation E.

Ritsuko: Bad-looking.

Asuka:  It's due to you that my battle for debut was heavily damaged.

Shinji: You can't say that! It's Souryuu who did silly thing.

Asuka:  Silly? How come you awkward guy can say that?

        Too rude!

Shinji: Don't be rude! You were too hasty to beat, and result that matter.

Asuka:  What was that? Something like floating corps in the sea!

        dishonourable!

Shinji: You cannot say that to me.

Maya:   Nerv gave up to carry out the operation at 11:03 a.m.

        Gave the right of order to UN second force.

Fuyuzuki: They are humilitating us.

Maya:   11:05, Attacked the targed with NN bomb.

Fuyuzuki: We have to re-draw the plan.

Maya:   Succeeded in burning down the 28% of the  component substance.

Asuka:  They've done?

Fuyuzuki: That is only keeping motionless.

        The next attack is the question of time.

Ryouji: Well, we earned the time to prepare. that's lucky.

Fuyuzuki: Listen to me! Do you know your business?

Asuka:  to pilot Eva.

Fuyuzuki: No! to win Angels.

        We Nerv's existence is not to show such a dishonourable deed.

        Therefore, you must cooperate and..

Shinji&Asuka: How come I have to cooperate with this kind a guy.

Fuyuzuki: Stop!

Asuka: Why do people get angry?

Ryouji: Old poeple don't want to be humiliated.

Shinji: Excuse me, where is Misato-san?

Ryouji: setlement. Responsible person is for the responsibility.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ritsuko: The papers for protesting and the reports of damage from

        the ministry concerned.

        And, this is the claimed payment from UN. And the complain 

        from the publicity section.

Misato: hmmmm.

Ritsuko: You must glance at these.

Misato: I know what's are written without reading.

        They say "if battle, do here."

Ritsuko: Good guess.

Misato: I will do the setlement of angels here.

        I will beat that angel!

Ritsuko: Vice commander is very angry!

        You will be transfered if you humiliate him again. No doubt!

Misato: It is good luck within bad luck that commander Ikari was absent.

Ritsuko: You would have got sacked before he'd read these.

Misato: You must be kind enough to bring me some good idea for me

        to avoid being sacked.

Ritsuko: Only one.

Misato: You are great! Dr. Akagi Ritsuko. Good to have is a kind

        old friend.

Ritsuko: You are wrong. It's not me that saves the tight pinch of an

        old friend. This idea is Kaji-kun's.

Misato: Kaji did?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: Hello, I'm back.... but no one here.. 

        WOW! What are these?

Asuka:  Don't be rude! these are my baggages.

Shinji: What What made you here.

Asuka:  Why you are still here?

Shinji: Still here?

Asuka:  You were sacked.

Shinji: Eh? ah!

Asuka:  Misato is going to live with me.

        Well, that choice is quite natural considering which is more

        excellent. To tell the truth, I wanna live with Kaji-san..

        Japanese style room is terrible small.

        That is not enough for the half of my baggage.

Shinji: Ah!! Oh, no!

Asuka:  And, why are Japanese people cautionless.

        How come you can live in a room without lock. Unbelievable.

Misato: Japanese mind is kindness and guessing others mind.

Shinji&Asuka:   Misato-san!

Misato: How are you! You two are going along well.

Shinji: What do you mean?

Asuka:  What?

Misato: The preparation for the next operation.

Shinji&Asuka:   How come?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: The seventh Angel has only one weakpoint.

        The heavy two point attack to the core during the separation.

        That's the only way.

        In other words, an attack by two Evas at the complete

        syncronized timing.

Shinji&Asuka: well..

Misato: So, you are going to live together from now on.

Shinji&Asuka:   Oh no!

Misato: NO! I don't accept. You know, Man and Woman must not live together

        after 7 years old. That's the proverb.

Misato: The angel is on the self-restoration.

        The second attack is predicted 6 days later. We have no time.

Asuka:  That's insane!

Misato: Well, the way to realize the insane thing is

        to master the attack pattern harmonized to this music.

        In six days. as soon as possible!

Shinji: well..

Asuka:  No!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
B part

Touji:  I am anxious about how Shinji is.. 

Kensuke:He's been absent from school for these three days.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Touji:  Oh, that's the Class Representative.

Hikari: Two of the Idiot trio.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Touji:  How come the class representative is here?

Hikari: I am going to inquire after Soryuu-san.

        I wonder why you are here.

Kensuke:  Inquire after Ikari-kun.

Three:  How come you stop here!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sinji&Asuka: Hi!

Touji:  You are betraying us!

Kensuke: More over, pair-look in this situation. I imagin something.

Shinji&Asuka: This is forced by Misato-san, who insists that Japanese should

        begin with form.

Hikari: You two are inpure!

Shinji&Asuka: You misunderstand!

Hikari: Nothing like misunderstanding or misoverstanding!

Misato: Hi, you are welcome!

Touji:  Please explain what is actually the matter!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Touji&Kensuke&Hikari: (Laugh)

Touji:  You should have told us first that!

Hikari: And the unison is going well?

Misato: Just like you see.

Touji&Kensuke&Hikari: Hmm..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  That's matter of fact! It's impossible for me to become this

        low level Shinji guy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: Then you give up?

Asuka:  There's no other one.

Misato: Rei!

Rei:    Yes.

Misato: You try.

Rei:    Yes.

Asuka:  Ah,,

Asuka:  Aha,,

Touji&Kensuke&Hikari:   hmmm..

Misato: This way, we'd better to change the plan and you'd better make a pair

        with Rei.

Asuka:  NO! I can't stand for. 

Shinji: Oh,

Hikari: Ah, Asuka-san!

Touji:  That's we call Tear in the devil's eye.

Hikari: Ikari-kun!

Shinji: Well, 

Hikari: You must run after her!

Shinji: What?

Hikari: You are responsible of her crying.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: Well, eh..

Asuka:  Don't say nothing.

        I know,, I know I must pilot Eva.

        I do. I will do.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  I must triumph over them! I must do!

Shinji: Oh, no, no good to triumph over them..

Asuka:  You are being too simplistic, although You are a man!

        I must revenge for my spoilt pride!

Shinji: WOW..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  Where's Misato?

Shinji: Job. Overnight job, she said in the phone.

Asuka:  Then, we are alone tonight.

Shinji: WOW! Oh, no!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: What?

Asuka:  This is unbreakable wall of Jerico.

Shinji: what?

Asuka:  If you invade across the wall, you shall be executed.

        Child must go to bed right now!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:  How come Japanese sleap on the floor. Unbelievable!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji: ummmm.

Shinji: hmmmm.

Shinji: Oh..

Asuka:  ah..

Shinji: wow!

Asuka:  Mom! mom!

Asuka:  hmmmmm

Shinji: you are a child as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: No, someone is staring.

Ryouji: Who?

Misato: Who? oh, mmmmm

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato: No. you are no longer my something.

        I beg you not to do this again.

Ryouji: But your lips want that.

Misato: uuuuuuu

Ryouji: Your lips and your words... which should I trust?

Misato: mmmmmmmmmm

Misato: mmmmmmmm

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ritsuko: Here you go.

Misato: Thanx.

Ritsuko: It's rare to see you not drunk, today.

Misato: mmm, un petit..

Ritsuko: business? or a man?

Misato: well, many things.

        You are always dull!

        What were you doing last night without sleaping!

Shinji: That was image training for the today's battle!

Asuka:  You are lying! You tried to kiss me at the lips.

Shinji: Unfair! You were awake that time?

Asuka:  That's terrible! I meant as a joke! You really did it?

        You kissed me?

Shinji: No, I didn't. I stopped.

        Say something against her.
        You are a man!

Shinji: Oh, I've expected it would be as it is.

Asuka:  I've already given up (the idea of going for the excursion)?

Shinji: Yes.

Asuka:  Oh, no! Pitiful! Worst kind of man is those tamed!

Shinji: Don't say in such a manner.

Misato: I know how you wanna go, but there's no other way.
        An angel would likely to attack us during your absence for the
        excursion.

PenPen: Ksh, Ksh, Quye, Cuo!

Asuka:  We always have to wait, wait wait wait!
        We are always waiting for the enemy whom we cannot expect when
        to come.
        Don't you figure out where they are and attack them first.

Misato: If we could, we would do that.
        Well, you must think it's a good chance.
        While others are going for the excursion, you can study.
        Do you think I am ignorant of this?

Misato: Oh, no!

Misato: You must know I know all without your confession.
        I can easily access the information on the result of the exams.

Asuka:  Phew! you stupid!
        What's the school result!
        I don't care about the exam with demerit mark method of old days.

Misato: In Rome, do as romans do.
        I hope you are used to the school life in Japan.

Asuka:  Fuck you!

- --
Hikari: Asuka, I will bring you some souvenir!

Kensuke: Oh, you are pitiful!

Touji:  We will enjoy for you!
- --
Operator: Hurry paste the data of Mt. Asamayama from Baltasar to Merchior.
# Baltasar and Merchior are two of three Magi.

Makoto: ....

Shigeru:....
- --
Ritsuko:School excursion?
        they are too relaxed in such a time.

Misato: It's because in such a time, they wanna play when they can play.
- --
Asuka:  What are you doin'?

Shinji: Studying science.

Asuka:  You are very obedient!

Shinji: Well, I have to do. Oh!

Asuka:  Hey look!
        Since I cannt do scuba diving at Okinawa, I dive here.

Shinji: I see.

Asuka:  hmm, let me see, what are you doing?
        Can't you solve this kinda easy formula?
        Ok, this is the solution.

Shinji: Eh!

Shinji: It's simple!

Shinji: How come you can solve this, while you get a bad result at the
        school exam

Asuka:  I did not figure out what was written in the exam.

Shinji: You say, you were not able to read the questions in Japanese?

Asuka:  That's right. I have not mastered all Kanji.
        I did not studied Kanji in the University there.

Shinji: University?

Asuka:  Yes. I graduated last year.
        What is written here?

Shinji: That's the problem of thermo-expansion.

Asuka:  Thermo-expansion? how childish!
        In short, things swell and get bigger when warmed,
        And shrink and get smaller when cooled, you know.

Shinji: I know that but...

Asuka:  In my case, do you think my breast will get bigger when warmed.

Shinji: Don't ask me! I have no idea!

Asuka:  Uninteresting guy!

Shinji: what?

Shinji: (sigh)

Asuka:  Look! Look! Shinji!

Shinji: ?

Asuka:  Backroll Entry!

Shinji: (sigh)

- --
Fuyuzuki:This does not give us a clear image.

Shigeru: But, this spot must be something, as is reported by Asamayama
        Research instutite of earth quake.

Fuyuzuki: Indeed, we must not ignore that.

Ritsuko: How did Magi judge?

Maya:   fifty Fifty.

Fuyuzuki: someone there?

Shigeru: Captain Katsuragi has already been there.
--------
Researcher: That's the limit!

Misato: Go ahead. 500 more.

Operator: depth 1200. Anti-pressure armour cracked.

Researcher: Katsuragi-san!

Misato: If broken, we will compensate for that. 200 more please.

Makoto: Detected by monitor!

Misato: Start analysis.

Makoto: Yes.

Operator: Probe compressed and crushed. Exploded.

Misato: How is analysis.

Makoto: We narrowly cleared.
        Pattern Blue!

Misato: No doubt. That's an Angel.
        This lab. is completely closed from now on.
        And is under Nerv's control.
        No entry to the room is permitted, and all the events of last 6 hours
        are secret to outside.
- --
Misato: Hurry to demand A17 to Commander Ikari.

Shigeru: Take care! That's normal line.

Misato: I know, hurry switch to the secret line.

- --
Comittee member: A17?

Comittee member: You attack from ourside.

Gendou: Yes.

Member: Not acceptable! Too dangerous! You cannot say you forget the
        case 15 years ago.

Gendou: It's a chance!
        We've been doing nothing but defending, but we can offend if..

Kirl:   You risk too much!

Gendou: But you know how important the sample of an Angel alive is.

Kirl:   No failure is allowed.

Fuyuzuki:Failure? In such a case, humanity will vanish!
        You really do it?
- --
Shinji: Is this an Angel?

Ritsuko: Yes. It's something like a chrysalis before adult.
        The number one priority for this operation is to capture
        the Angel.
        Capture it alive and conserve the shape as original as possible.

Asuka:  If fail..

Ritsuko: Annihilate it as soon as possible!  Alright?

Shinji&Rei&Asuka: Yes.

Ritsuko: Who carries out?

Asuka: It's I! I dive!

Shinji: But, it must be me.

Ritsuko:Asuka.

Shinji: Oh,

Ritsuko: You carry out in Unit02.

Asuka:  Yes. It's easy!

Rei:    How about me?

Maya:   Prototype Unit0 is out of standard for the special equipment.

Ritsuko: I order, Rei and Unit00 stay at Headquarter.

Rei:    Yes.

Asuka:  It's pitiful for you that you cannot go to the hot spring.

Ritsuko: Since A17 was ordered, we go as soon as possible. Be ready.

Shinji&Asuka: Yes.

- --
Asuka:  Oh, this anti-heat plug suits has nothing different from the
        normal one.

Ritsuko: Switch on at the right.

Asuka:  Oh, no! What's this!

Ritsuko: Unit02 is ready.

- --
Asuka:  Oh, no! what's this!

Ritsuko: Anti-heat, anti-pressure, and anti-nuclear special suits.
        The Type-D equipment for extream region.

Asuka:  Is that my Unit02?
        No, I don't want to go.
        I don't show myself before public.
        Shinji will become this kind a job!

Ryouji: Oh, I am very sorry for that.
        I expected Asuka's mighty deed.

Asuka:  Oh, no, I don't have that courage to show this badlooking appearence
        to Kanji-san.
Maya:   hmmm, troubled.

Ritsuko: well..yes.

Shinji:  Then, I will,

Rei:    I go with Uni02.

Asuka:  mmmmm,
        I don't allow you to touch my Unit02, Excuse me.
        It's not First but I that go.

        Be patient for the badlooking appearence.

- ----B PART----

Operator: Eva Unit01 and Unit02 arrived.

Misato: Two Units wait at the position.
        Hurry prepare for laser shot and crane.

Makoto: Roger

- --
Asuka:  Oh, Where is Kaji-san?

Misato: That guy idiot won't come. No business for him.

Asuka:  Shit! I've wanted to show him my good job.

----------
Woman:  A17 was ordered. That also means freezing the present assets.

Ryoji:  Those who are troubled are many.

Woman:  Why didn't you stop him?

Ryouji: There's no reason to stop. The order is official.

Woman:  But, Nerv's failure means the annihilation of the world.

Ryouji: They are not that arrogant.

- --
Shinji: What's that?

Ritsuko: UN and Airforce is watching and waiting above us.

Maya:   Until the end of this operation.

Asuka:  They help us?

Ritsuko: No, they will settle,

Maya:   when we fail.

Asuka:  What do you mean?

Ritsuko: They bomb the Angel with N2 bomb together with us.

Asuka:  Terrible!

Shinji: Who order such a thing?

Ritsuko: Commander Ikari.

Shinji: Asshole!

- --
Operator:       Laser operation complete.

Shigeru: Course secured.

Maya:   Type-D equipment no problem.

Makoto: Unit02 set position ready.
- --
Misato: Roger.
        Asuka, are you ready?

Asuka:  Anytime OK.

Misato: Go!

- --
Asuka:  Oh, looks hot!

Maya:   Unit02 breaks into leva.

Asuka:  Look! Look! Shinji!

Shinji: What?

Asuka:  Giant Stroke Entry!

Shinji: (sigh)

Asuka:  Present depth 170, Speed of descending 20. Every part no problem.
        View sight is Zero. I can't see nothing.
        Switch to CT monitor.
        But the range of sight is 120.

Maya:   Depth 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650,

Maya:   900, 950, 1000, 1020,
        over the safety depth.
        Depth 1300. Predicted Target point.

Misato: Asuka, can you see something?

Asuka:  Nothing detected. No one here.

Ritsuko: Leva flow is faster than expected.

Makoto: target motion speed is different from the prediction.

Misato: Hurry up Re-calculation! Operation continued.
        Descend farther.

Makoto: Oh, no!

Maya:   Depth 1350, 1400,,

Operator: Second circulation pipe cracked.

Maya:   Depth 1480. Over the limit depth.

Misato: Not yet encountered the target. Continue.
        Asuka, how about the status?

Asuka:  Still withstanding. I wanna complete the job and have a shower.

Misato: I know a good hot spring near here. Let's go after the job.
        Hang in there, a little more.

Asuka:  Ha.. n?

Maya:   Limit depth plus 120

Asuka:  well?

Operator: Eva Unit02 lost prog knife.

Maya:   Limit depth plus 200.

Makoto: Katsuragi-san, no more!
        This time the devise is manned.

Misato: I am responsible of this operation. Continue.

Asuka:  Yes it is. No problem. I can go farther.

Maya:   Depth 1780. Predicted target position by the re-calculation.

Asuka:  Here it is!

Makoto: Target in sight.

Misato: Prepare for capture.

Ritsuko: Since You and the target are driven by flow,
        there's only one chance for the contact.

Asuka:  I know. Trust me!

Makoto: 30 to the target contact.

Asuka:  Relative speed 2.2. Target in range.

Asuka:  Expanding Electromagnetic cage, no problem. Target captured.

Maya:   Oh,

Makoto: Phew!

Misato: Nice! Asuka!

Asuka:  Phew! Capture operation complete. ascending.

Asuka;  Out of the question.
        Easier to bear than to worry. You konw.
        It was easy job for me.
        But, This is more like sauna suit than plug suit.
        I wanna go hot spring!

Ritsuko: Tension was released at once.

Misato: really?

Ritsuko: You've been afraid of the today's operation?

Misato: Well, yes. if wrongly done, another that..

Ritsuko: Yes. second impact... I don't want that again.

Asuka:  What's this?

Ritsuko: Oh, no, that begin emergence. Earlier than calculated.

Misato: how about the cage?

Makoto: No can withstand.

Misato: Cancel capturing. Deposit the cage!

Asuka:  Oh, no!

Misato: Operation change. Annihilation of Angel is No.1 priority.

OPENING THEME SONG 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the street. Children's voices are heard from somewhere.

Children: Ha ha ha ... 

Children: Ahahahaha. Try to hit. 

Children: Eh. 

Children: (laugh) 

Children: Yeah, I hit it. I hit it! 

 *Shigeru buys a drink can at a vending machine.

 *"Coin Cleaning - 24 hour OK"

 *Maya and Ritsuko is in the shop.

Cleaning Machine: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. 

Ritsuko: Cleaning doesn't come cheap 

Maya: I want to have time for washing myself at least, don't you
   think? 

Shigeru: We're better because we can go back home at least. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *A ticket gate of the subway

 *A train is coming to the station

 *Kozo is reading a newspaper

 *Ritsuko, Shigeru and Maya

Ritsuko: My, Sub Commander. 

Ritsuko: Good morning. 

Shigeru&Maya: Good morning, sir. 

Kozo: Well. Morning. 

Ritsuko: So early today. 

Kozo: To the upper town for Ikari. 

Ritsuko: I see. The committee's regular meeting today, I suppose. 

Kozo: Silly business. Ikari always force trivial duties on me as he
   did. I don't know how to do them without Magi. 

Ritsuko: A city councilmen's election will take place in the upper
   town soon. 

Kozo: The city council is only just a decoration. Actually it's Magi
   which is in charge of this city. 

Maya: Magi. Do you mean three super computers? 

Kozo: It is operated by majority rule of three kinds of computers.
   The system is exactly based on the decocratic fundamentals. 

Maya: Does the council only follow Magi's decisions? 

Kozo: It's an effective government which can minimize wastes. 

Maya: The scientific city that it is. It's the era when the science
   is omnipotent. 

Shigeru: Old-fashioned words. 

Kozo: Come to think of it, you'll have an experiment of Unit-01,
   won't you? 

Ritsuko: Yes, from 10:30 today the second experiment for extending
   the activating time is to take place. 

Kozo: I'm expecting good news. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *The panel shows "Emergency"

 *Ritsuko at the laboratory for the experiment

Ritsuko: Stop the experiment. Cut off the circuits. 

 *Eva-00 in the cage

Maya: Switch the circuits. 

Male Staff: Power supply is getting operating. 

Ritsuko: This is a problem as I thought. 

Maya: Yes. I'm worrying that the converson efficiency is no less than
   0.008 lower than the theoretical value. 

Male Staff: The value is right up to the largest mesurement error.
   What shall we do? 

Ritsuko: Lower the interconversion by 0.01 and try with the same
   setting again. 

Maya: Rodger. 

Ritsuko: Well, we're starting an reactivation experiment. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the still darkness 

Episode 11 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Misato in the elevator

 *Ryoji is running to the elevator

Ryoji: Hey! Just a moment! 

 *Misato push the button for closing the door

Ryoji: Ouch! 

Misato: Shit! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Misato and Ryoji in the elevator

Ryoji: Yeah. I ran and ran. Ha. You seem to be in a bad mood today. 

Misato: Because I saw you just after I came here. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji at a payphone

Telephone Operator: Yes. Hold on, please. 

Gendo: What? 

Shinji: Er ... Err ... Well, Father. 

Gendo: What's the matter? Be quick! 

Shinji: Haa 

Shinji: Err, well ... Today at the school, I told me to report to my
   parent that an interview for career guidance will take place. But
   ... 

Gendo: I've entrusted Katsuragi-kun with such things. Don't call me
   for a silly thing. Don't pass on such a phonecall to me. 

Shinji: Ah! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Elevator suddenly stops

Misato: My. 

 *Blackout

Ryoji: A power failure? 

Misato: That can't be. It can't happen. 

Misato: Something strange. An accident? 

Ryoji: Akagi goofed up an experiment? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *in the laboratory

Maya: The main power supply isn't operating. The voltage is zero. 

Ritsuko: No. I did nothing. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator

Ryoji: What do you think? 

Misato: But the power supply will be switched to the standby soon. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the control room

Shigeru: No. Standby circuit isn't operating. 

Kozo: That can't be. How are operating circuits? 

Female staff: 1.2 percent in all. Only 9 circuits from No.2567. 

Kozo: Use all operating power supplies to maintain Magi and Central
   Dogma. 

Shigeru: But it will interfere with life-supporting in the entire
   buildings. 

Kozo: It's OK. The top priority issue. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Makoto in the town with Misato's laundry

Female Announcement: Remember Takahasi Nozomu, Takahashi Nozomu.
   Thank you for your supports. 

Makoto: She is really a slovenly person. I think that Katsuragi-san
   ought to take her own laundry herself. What? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka on the street

Asuka: It's only because Commander Ikari was actually too busy. 

Shinji: I wonder about that. I thought that a failure occurred rather
   than he hung up. 

Asuka: For being a man, you had not better worry about such every
   little detail, don't you think? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *At the entrance of Nerv Headquarters

 *The gate doesn't work

Shinji: What? 

Asuka: What are you doing? Hey, take my place. Hmm. Ah? Hmm, hmm,
   hmm. Damn it! This must be broken! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Male staff tries to open the door by force

Staff: Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. 

 *Ritsuko and Maya go through the open door

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Ritsuko and Maya walks on the passsage.

Ritsuko: Anyway let's hurry to the control center. I can't believe
   that the power supplies hasn't been restored. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator Misato repeats to push a button

Misato: It's an emergency. 

Ryoji: What is the power supply system? 

Misato: Main, Sub, Standby. Three systems. It can't believe that all
   systems fail at the same time. 

Ryoji: That means ... 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo's face in the control room

Gendo: We have to think that rather breakers were activated by
   someone than they work correctly. 

Kozo: No matter what caused it, we'll be involved in a big trouble if
   Angel appears at such a time. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Fuchu Overall Headquarters of UN Force

 *General Watch & Control Room

Male Operator: An unidentified object has been detected by the search
   rader. 

Commander C: It may be the eighth guy. 

Commander A: Yes. It must be Angel. 

Commander C: What shall we do? 

Commander B: 

Commander A: Anyhow its destination is Tokyo-3. 

Commander C: I agree. We have nothing to do. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Angel is coming in a lake

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the Fuchu UN Headquarters

Male Operator: Angel has landed. 

Female Operator: It is still coming. 

Commander C: How is Tokyo-3? 

Female Operator: It has kept silent. 

Commander A: What on earth are the guys of Nerv doing? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Ritsuko and Maya climbs up the wall

Ritsuko: I thought that a trap was only just an old-fashioned
   ornament. I couldn't imagine that I use it. 

Maya: Providing is preventing. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Asuka, Shinji and Rei tries to push buttons to open doors

Asuka: Hmm... This doesn't work, too. 

Rei: All facilities don't work. It's strange. 

Asuka: Something happened in Geo-front? 

Rei: It's natural to think so. 

Shinji: Anyway let's make a contact with Nerv Headquarters. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator

Misato: Huh. No. Even an emergency phone doesn't work. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the control room

Shigeru: No. Line 77 isn't operating, too. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Rei and Asuka try to call

Rei: No. I can't make a contact. 

Asuka: Me, too. Neither the wire one nor the emergency line are out
   of service. 

Shinji: Well. What shall we do? 

Asuka: Ah. Nn, nn, 

Shinji: What are you doing? 

Asuka: You, an idiot? An emergency manual.

Shinji: Ah. 

Asuka: Of course, I must be a leader. You have no objection, do you?
   Let's go!

Makoto: Ah, I'm lucky! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator

Announcer: Due to the state of special emergency in this district, an
   emergency vehecle is going ..... Hey, the dead end, don't you
   know? 

Makoto: It's OK. Drive into there! 

Announcer: Eh, my! 

Makoto: Anyhow, it's emergency now. 

Driver: Rodger. 

Help! Stop it! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Geo-front

Kozo: This Geo-front was designed as a self-sufficient colony if it
   is isolated from outside. It's can't be happen theoretically that
   all the power supplies 

Ritsuko: It means that somebody did intently. 

Gendo: I guess that their purpose is the research of this place. 

 *In the control room

Ritsuko: You mean that they want to guess the structures of
   Headquarters from the recovery procedures. 

Kozo: What annoying guys! 

Ritsuko: I'll run dummy programs on Magi because they makes it
   difficult for them to gasp the whole. 

Gendo: I leave it all to you. 

Ritsuko: Yes. 

Kozo: That the first damage of Headquarters should be made by no less
   the people than we are. I cannot bear the thought. 

Gendo: After all, an enemy of man is man. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka walks in the dark

Shinji: It usually takes only two minutes to go there. Is true that
   this is a passage. 

Asuka: If we reach there, I'm sure that we can enter the Geo-front. 

Shinji: I heard the same words fourth times for some time. 

Asuka: You mind trifles indeed! You're so hung up on minor points. 

Rei: Be quiet. 

Asuka: What, excellent girl. 

Rei: A voice. 

Makoto: Angel is coming, repeat.... 

 *A light is coming

Shinji&Asuka: It's Hyuga-san. Heeey! 

Shinji: Hey! 

Makoto: Angel is coming, repeat, Angel is coming now! 

Shinji&Asuka: Angel is coming! 

Rei: We mustn't waste time. Let's take a shortcut. 

Asuka: I'm the leader. Don't take the initiative without my
   permission. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Asuka, Shinji and Rei crawl through a duct

Asuka: Shit. Though this is a shortcut, we look too bad. 

Shinji: Listen, what do you think Angels are? 

Asuka: What are you saying in such a situation? 

Shinji: Angels, messengers of the God. Our enemies of Angel names.
   Why are we fighting against them? 

Asuka: You, an idiot? Unidentified guys are invading to us, you know.
   It's natural that we have to deal with a lot of difficulties
   coming unexpectedly down on our heads. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka stands in front of two branches

Asuka: Weeell, to the right. 

Rei: To the left in my opinion. 

Asuka: Don't bother me! What do you think, Shinji?! 

Shinji: Hmmm, I don't know. 

Asuka: Hey, come on! As I'm the leader, you had better just follow
   me. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka go through the passage

Shinji: Something seems to be strange as I expected. The road leads
   up. 

Asuka: What do you mean by 'as I expected'. You are always saying too
   much! Ah! Look! I'm sure this time. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Asuka open a door with her kick and meet Angel

Asuka: (Deaa! Ii! Uh! Hii! Nnnn. Huh.) We checked the angel with the
   naked eyes. Then we knew that we must hurry up, don't you think? 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A car is rushing into the control room

Staff: (Uwaa!) 

Makoto: Angel is coming now. I suggest that Eva must be ready for
   sortie. 

Maya: It's a big trouble. 

Gendo: Fuyutsuki, I leave everything to you. 

Kozo: Ikari. 

Gendo: I'm going to prepare the sorties of Evas at the cage. 

Kozo: You mean that you'll operate manually? 

Gendo: We have an diesel one for the emergency. 

Kozo: But we have no pilots. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka

Shinji: Again. 

Rei: Over here. 

Shinji&Asuka: Eh? 

Asuka: (Nn?) 

Shinji: Ah! 

Asuka: You're a favorite with Commander Ikari, aren't you? An
   excellent girl loved is different from us. 

Shinji: Stop it at such a time. 

Asuka: You always can be a smug-looking girl. 

Asuka: (Kuu) 

Asuka: Hey, don't make a fool of me because you are favored. 

Rei: I don't make a fool of you. I'm not favored. I know it well. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *The staff pulls the entry plugs from Evas with ropes at the cage

Staff: Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho....

Staff: But we don't have any pilots now. 

Ritsuko: Don't worry. I'm sure that they will come. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka

Shinji: I can't open this door by my hands. 

Rei: It can't be helped. Let's break the duct and go ahead through
   it. 

Asuka: I shouldn't trifle with First. She is the kind of person who
   sticks at nothing to achieve her aims. She is what is called a
   self-righteous one. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo and the staff pull ropes

Staff: Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho....

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka crawl through a duct

Shinji: Uh! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Ritsuko and Maya in the cage

Asuka: I told you not to see. 

Shinji: There is nothing for it but to see. If I don't see forward, I
   can't advanc... 

 *Shinji and asuka fall from the duct. Rei jump and stand on the floor

Shinji&Asuka: (Wa, Uwaa!) 

Shinji: Uh! 

Asuka: Ouch! 

Shinji: Shit! 

Asuka: Ah! 

Shinji: Oh! 

Ritsuko: You guys. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo at the cage

Gendo: Be ready for entries of each! 

Staff: Rodger. Open the hatches manually. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji approaches Ritsuko

Shinji: How are Evas? 

Ritsuko: They're ready. 

Shinji: How? Although anything doesn't work. 

Ritsuko: By human hands. This idea was from Commander. 

Shinji: Father's. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Gendo pulls the rope with the staff to open the door of the entry
  plug

Staff: Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho.... 

Ritsuko: Commander Ikari has been preparing because you would come
   here. 

Staff: Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho. Yo-heave -ho.... 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Evas try to remove the bindings

 *Makoto cry through a speaker

Makoto: The target is staying just above us. 

Ritsuko: Preperations, hurry up! 

Maya: Emergency batteries have been equipped with them. 

Ritsuko: Well. They're ready. Sortie! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Evas crawl throught a duct

Asuka: I look too ugly! 

Rei: We're getting to the pit. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Eva-02 kicks and opens a door to a pit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Evas climb up the pit

Asuka: Oh, my! I look so ugly again. (Ha!) 

Rei: Watch out! Dodge it! 

Asuka: What? Oh! No! Uh! 

 *Evas fall down

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Evas stop falling down

 *Angel put its solvent liquid through the pit

 *Evas escape to a tunnel

Rei: The target is trying to invade Headquarters directly with strong
   solvent liquid. 

Shinji: What shall we do? 

Asuka: Of course, we'll beat down it! 

Shinji: Sure but how are you going to do it? I dropped my rifle and
   the batteries on our backs are empty. We'll able to move for no
   more than three minutes. 

Asuka: I have a plan. Defense stays here, neutralizes AT field and
   also protects Offense from Angel's solvent liquid. Backup go down,
   picks up the dropped rifle and gives it to Offense. And then
   Offense destroys the target by a salvo of the rifle. 

Rei: I see. I'll be Defense. 

Asuka: Sorry, I'll do it. 

Shinji: It's so dangerous. 

Asuka: That's the reason. I feel funny unless I don't get even with
   you at the last battle. Shinji is Offense. Excellent girl is
   Backup. All right? 

Rei: I see. 

Shinji: Uh! 

Asuka: Let's go! (Geehn) 

Asuka: (N,n,n) 

Shinji: Ayanami! Asuka, clear the way! 

Asuka: I've got even with you. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *In the elevator Misato is on Ryoji's shoulder

Misato: Damn it! Why does it open?! It's an emergency! I have a
   toilet accident! Uh! Hey! I told you not to look up! 

Ryoji: OK, OK. 

 *Power is recovered

 *The door opens

Misato: (Ya ra a) Hey! Ahhh! 

Ryoji: Oh. Oops....(Uwaa) 

Ritsuko, Maya and Makoto: Huh... 

Misato: (N, n, nn 

Ryoji: (N, nn) 

Ritsuko: (n, nn) 

Maya: Dirty... 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *Shinji, Rei and Asuka lies on the hill

Shinji: It's ironic that the stars are very beautiful like this
   without electric artificial lights. 

Asuka: But I don't feel that the people live there. Look, I feel easy
   with this. 

Rei: Man fears darkness and scrape it away with fire to survive. 

Asuka: Philosophy! 

Shinji: For that reason, I'm wonder if man is a special creature. So
   Angels are attacking against us. 

Asuka: You, an idiot?! Of course, I can't see any reason! 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Trailer: 

Misato is vexed at eliminating Angels. Her past are told. But Angel
   which comes from the stratosphere made the people throw away all
   hopes. Next time is "The calue of a miracle" . Watch it all
   together.

Kensuke : Misato-san's Signiture. The number of lines has increased to two.
        That means she promoted from Captain to Major.

Asuka : Oh , I did not notice that.

Shinji : I wonder when...

Touji : Are you serious? What a dull guys.

Kensuke : Oh! Don't you have a bit of sense of sympathy?
        It's not that easy for a young woman in her age 
        to take care of two junior high student.

Touji : It's only WE that have a human mind.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Maya : Number 0 and 2 adjoin contamination zone, it's the limit.

Maya : Almost reaching the contamination zone.

Rituko : But this readings? He's great.

Maya : His Harmonics and synchronization ratio are coming close upon Asuka's.

Rituko : It is a talent, isn't it?

Operator : He is indeed a child born destined ride EVA.

Misato : He doesn't wish that. He is not glad at that.

Rituko : All tests are over.

Rituko : Shinji-kun , you did a good job.

Shinji : What do you mean?

Rituko : Your harmonics value is 8point better than privious.
        Good reading!

Touji : No , no! It is this guy that planned this.

Kensuke : Yes, the planning and scheduling were  by this Aida Kensuke
        this Aida Kensuke!

Misato : Thank you , Aida-kun.

Kensuke : You are welcome. I did nothing worth your gratitude. 
        That's natural.

Touji : Anyhow , why is Class Rep. here?

Asuka : I invited her.

Asuka :  & hikari: Yeah!

Misato : Rei is ...?

Asuka : I indeed invited her. But That girl is difficult girl to be with.

Asuka : Oh , Kaji-san hasn't come yet.

Hikari : Is he that COOL GUY? Kajisan is..?

Asuka : Surely yes! Kaji-san is completely different from this clamp,
        it's just like day and night. 
        It's insult to Kaji-san to compare him with.

Touji : What you say?

Misato : Is it still difficult for you to be here in this kind of situation?

Shinji : But I am not that used to be with many people.
        Why must we make a fuss?
        Your promotion suggests that Misato-san is appreciated by
        people. doesn't it?

Misato : Well, it may be.

Shinji : That's why they are happy. But you do not look happy.

Misato : Oh, yes, I am happy. Yes, happy.
        But, that's not why I am here.

Shinji : Then, why did you join NERV?

Misato : Well, I don't remember why, because it's long since been that.

<>

Asuka : It must be Kaji-san. No doubt! Oh!

Ryouji : I've come directly from Headquarter. I met her on the way.

Asuka & Misato : I suspect you two.

Rituko : Is that a jealousy?

Misato : Absolutly NO!

Ryouji : Anyhow, Congratulation! Major Katsuragi!
        I have to be polite to you from now on.

Misato : What are you saying! Idiot!

Ryouji : Well, it's an unprecedented matter that both of CO and EXO are
        gone out from Japan.
        That's how they rely on Katsuragi.

Shinji : My father is out here?

Rituko : Commander Ikari is on the South Pole.at the moment

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Kouzou : Nothing living is allowed to exist here in the world of death,
        Antarctica.
        Or rather we should call it "hell".

Gendou : Nevertheless, we, human beings, are standing here, living as
        living things.

Kouzou : Because we are protected by the power of science.

Gendou : Science is human power.

Kouzou : That arrogance caused the tragedy 15 years ago, the Second Impact.
        And this scene is the result. 
        It's too big punishment for us considering our crime. 
        It's just like the Dead Sea!

Gendou : Yet, this is a purified world without impurity of the original sin.

Kouzou : I prefer a world where people live, no matter how it is
        smeared with the sin.

Operator : Situation Report from NERV headquarter sir.
        An angel was discovered in the satellite orbit above Indian Ocean.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Makoto : The angel appeared suddenly two minutes ago.

Operator(woman) : Set the 6th search satellite on the orbit.

Operator(man) : 2 minutes to contact.

Shigeru : Target in sight.

Shigeru : Ohh.

Makoto : It's terrible.

Misato : Out of common sense.

Shigeru : 6th satellite going to close contact to the target.

Operator(woman) : Start searching.

Operator(man) : Starting Data transmission.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Misato : A.T. field?

Rituko : It's a new way of using it.

Misato : What a great power of destruction! That's A.T.field!

Maya : That is making use of the dropping energy.
        he Angel itself is something like a bomb.

Rituko : Anyhow, the first shot hit the Pacific ocean far from
        its target. And the second shot hit that point.
        After that, Steadly correcting errors.

Misato : That means it is learning.

Makoto : N2 bombing does not work.

Shigeru : The angel missing after that.

Misato : Maybe it comes.

Rituko : Next time, Maybe it drops itself.

Misato : That will make 3d Lake Ashinoko.

Rituko : All of Lake Fuji will be merged into one and will be
        linked to Pacific Ocean, destroying HeadQuarter.

Misato : Commander Ikari's status?

Shigeru : Connection impossible due to the Angel's strong jamming.

Misato : How is Magi's judgment?

Maya : They recommend evacuation unanimously.

Rituko : What do you do? You are the present responsible person.

Misato : Connect to Japan's ministries concerned. Special
        declaration D17 under the right of NERV. Evacuation for All
        citizens within the radius 50km.  Request the backup of Magi
        to Matsushiro.

Makoto : We abandon this?

Misato : No. But It is not necessary to risk all of us.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Announce(man) : A special declaration D17 was announced by the government. 
        All citizens, take shelter in the designated place immediately.

Announce(woman) : The six and seven blocks for the priority,
         move according to the instruction from the chief of a ward's
        direction immediately.

Announce(man) : All refuges in the city complete.

Announce(woman) : The evacuation of noncombatants and Class D personnels
        by the Alarm C is complete.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Rituko : You do ? Are you serious?

Misato : Absolutely Yes.

Rituko : Are you going to abandon three Eva units in your selfish accord?
        The probability of win is only 0.00001. That's smaller than one
        out of 10 thousand.

Rituko : Major Katsuragi!

Misato : I am the present responsible person. I want to do all that I must
        to do. My job is to annihilate Angels.

Rituko : Your job ? Must be a joke! It's for your own sake! It's your
        revenge against Angels.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－

Asuka : Wow, receive by hand?

Misato : Sure! Arranging Evas at the estimated collision point, and you 
        directly receive with full A.T. field.

Shinji : In the case that the Angel goes out of the course considerably ..?

Misato : Then it's over.

Asuka : In the case that the Units cannot withstand the shock ..?

Misato : Also it's over.

Shinji : The probability of win is?

Misato : I have no idea. God knows.

Asuka : If successful, that's miracle!

Misato : It's not until we cause a miracle that the miracle is valuable.

Asuka : In other words, you say, we must manage to do that.

Misato : Sorry but there's no other way. This operation is...

Asuka : You say this an operation? Is this?

Misato : No, you don't say. If you are not willing, you can refuse that.

Misato : Are you OK with that?
        Officially you are required to write SOP(Standing Operational
        Procedures). Do you write that?

Asuka : No. I ain't going to die.

Rei : Neither do I. No need.

Shinji : Neither do I.

Misato : I'm sorry for you. When the operation is over , I will 
        invite you to a steak dinner.

Asuka : Oh , really?

Misato : I swear.

Shinji : WOW

Asuka : Don't forget.

>Misato : You can expect that.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Shinji : Steak means a gorgeous dinner!

Asuka : Does she really consider that the children now-a-days would 
        be glad at steak dinner?
        How poorsome the people of the Second Impact Generations are!

Shinji : No way for them.

Asuka : Hey! What was that "WOW"? I know you pretended to be happy.

Shinji : It's nicer if she can lead us at ease.

Asuka : Anyhow , she is going to invite us.
        Where to go? 
        You must come this time!

Rei : I won't.

Shinji : Why not?

Rei : I dislike meat.
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Maya : Target missing in sight due to the Angel's ECM.

Misato : Being impossible to estimate the exact point, this is the 
        collision point collision estimated by Magi
        from the data obtained just before missing.

Asuka : The range is this wide?

Shinji : The distance from the end to end is quite long.

Rituko : With the target's A.T. field , it can annihilate our headquarter
        completely.

Misato : Under these conditions, we set each Eva Unit at each
        of these three points.

Rei : What is this setting based on?

Misato : It's my intuition.

Asuka & Shinji : Intuition?

Misato : Sure. Woman's intuition.

Asuka : How coarse! I feel the miracle is going farther and farther.

Shinji : Misato-san never hit the lot.

Asuka : gee.
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－

Shinji : Hey!

Asuka : What?

Asuka : Asuka , why you are in Eva?

Shinji : Obviously, To show my talent to the world.

Shinji : To show your existence?

Asuka : That may do.

Asuka : Don't you ask that girl?

Shinji : It asked Ayanami before.

Asuka : Huuum , you and she are intimate friends.

Shinji : It doesn't mean that.

Asuka : How about you, Shinji?

Shinji : No idea.

Asuka : No idea? You must be a fool.

Shinji : I might be.

Asuka : you are really fool.

Maya : 120 minutes to the estimated collision time.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Misato : You take shelter. I will do the job here.

Shigeru : No. This is my job as well.

Makoto : I don't make only children fall in danger.

Misato : They are OK. No matter how Evas are damaged,
        A.T. field will save them. Inside Eva is the safest.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Misato : Shinji-kun, you asked yesterday why I joined NERV.
        My father threw himself into his research,... only his dream.
        I did not forgive him, or rather , I did hate him.

Shinji : Just like my father.

Misato : He didn't take care of me, my mother and the family. People said
        that he was sensitive. But he was so weak that he was always
        trying to escape from the reality, our family. He was just like a kid.
        I agreed with my mother when she divorced my father, since
        she had been always crying. My father seemed to have shocked,
        though I grinned him who was suffering from the consequence of
        his own.  He saved me for his life, and then died, in that
        Second impact.  I don't see if I'd loved him or hated him.
        One thing clear was that I had to defeat the Angels that had
        caused the Second Impact. To do that, I joined NERV. It might
        be that I was trying to revenge on my father, in order to be
        free from my father's spell.

Shinji : Don't shirk away! , Don't shirk away! , Don't shirk away!
        So don't shirk away.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Shigeru : Target insight by Maximum telescopic.

Makoto : Distance approximately 25000.

Misato : That's come! All Eva Units to the start position.
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Misato : The target's trajectory is calculated based only on the
        optical observation. Magi will induce you until the distance is
        1000. After that, do on your own accord. I entrust you all.

Shigeru : The angel approaching. Distance approximately 20000.

Misato : Then, operation start.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Shinji : Here we go!
        Start!
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Shigeru : Distance 12000.
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Shinji : Field to full!
        Uhh.

Rei : Unit two, field to full.

Asuka : Me too.

Shinji : Right now!

Asuka : This guy!

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Asuka : Huuum.

Shigeru : Wireless system recovered. Connection from Commander Ikari in 
        Antarctica.

Misato : Connect.

Shigeru : Yes sir.

Misato : I'm very sorry. Unit one was damaged due to my selfish judgment. I am 
        completely responsible for that.

Kouzou : I don't care. The annihilation of Angels is the Eva's mission. It
        was good luck that the damage was that small.

Gendou : Yes. You've done it. Major Katsuragi.

Misato : Thank you sir.

Gendou : By the way , is there the pilot of Unit 1.

Shinji : Yes.

Gendou : I've heard the story. You did it. Shinji.

Shinji : Eh? yes.

Gendou : Then, Major Katsuragi, I entrust the settlement to you.

Misato : Yes sir.
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Announce : Next station is Shin-Miyanoshita , Shin-Miyanoshita. Exits on
        the left side at the next station.

Asuka : You must accomplish the promise.

Misato : Alright. I've drawn big bills from the bank. I can pay for the
        full-course dinner,... although shortly before the payday. 
－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－
Paper lantern at a Chinese noodles stand

Asuka : I know the contents of your wallet. Take it easy.
        The honor student told that she would come with us for Chinese noodle.

Rei : I am a Garlic noodle without baked pork.

Asuka : I am a Shirk fin plus baked pork big size.

Proprietor of the stand : Here you go the Shirk fin plus baked pork.

Shinji : Hey Misato-san.

Misato : What?

Shinji : When I heard my father's words, I found for the first time that
        it's glad to be praised.
        And I also found... that I pilot Eva to hear those words from my
        father.

Asuka : That's why you pilot?
        Truly idiot!

EVANGELION Episode13

 Computer Room like place
 Ritsuko, Keyboarding sound

Female Operater: Apothosis Operation of the three EVA units will be done as 
        scheduled as MAGI system resumes its operation.

Male Operater: Operation comfirmed.  Abbreviate 450 to 670.

Makoto(Glasses): Command center, consented.

Ritsuko:You are fast.  After all, you are Maya.

Maya:   Of course.  You directly taught me.

Ritsuko:Oh, wait.  A8 would be faster there.  Let me see.

Maya:   After all, she taught me.

Misato coming up in elevater

Misato: How's going?  Is MAGI's check-up finished?

Ritsuko:Almost done.  As I promised, I made it by the today's test.

Misato: You are great, Ritsuko.  You have three of those same hard-to-take-
        care-of things, and still making it by time.

Ritsuko: That one is cold.

Misato: Ugha!

-------------------------------
Control Center.  MAGI on the screen.

Male Operater: All three MAGI systems are now on the self-diagnosis mode.

Maya:   127th periodic check-up, all clear.

Ritsuko:Understood.  Well done, and take a rest till the test.

------------------------------
Ladies' Room.  Ritusko washing face.

Ritsuko:All clear...  Today too, my mother is just fine, but am I just aging?

An Elevater ascend the huge vertical hole

Asuka: What?  Undress Again?

Ritsuko: From here on is the super clean room.  Just takeing shower and
        changing your undies are not enough.

Asuka:  Why should I do all these things just for the auto-piloting test?

Ritsuko:Not only the time progresses but also the technology of EVA.  We
        need the new datas all the time.

Asuka: What?

------------------
Door Opens.  All three pilots are naked.

Asuka:  Now, I am as you wanted.  Washed and cleansed for seventeen times.

Ritsuko:Now, all three of you, go through this room, stay as you are now, 
        and get into the entry plug.

Asuka:  WHAT?!

Ritsuko:Don't warry.  The vidual moniters were turned off.  Your privacy 
        is protected.

Asuka:  That's not the point.  It's about how I feel.

Ritsuko:This test's point is to do harmonics directly from the body, without 
        the assistance of the plug suit.

Misato: Asuka, It's an order.

Asuka:  OooooKeeey!  DO NOT watch, OK?

---------------------------------------
Male Operater:All pilots prepared for entry.

Ritsuko:Start the test.

EVA's simulation bodies are floating in the water.

Male Operater: Start testing.  Start memorizing auto-piloting.

Male Operater:Inserting simulation plug.

Female Operater:Connecting systems with simulation bodies.

Female Operater:Simulation plug is now under control of MAGI.

Misato: It's so fast. MAGI, oh great MAGI.  I just cannot believe it took
        a week on the first test.

Male Operater:According to the schedule, this test should end in three hours. 

Ritsuko: How are you feeling.

Rei:    Something is different.

Shinji: Yes.  Something is different from the other times.

Asuka:  Something is wrong with my senses.  Only the right arm is clear, and
        the rest is dim.

Ritsuko:Rei, image the movement of the right arm.

Rei:    Yes.

Male Operater:Doing well on data collection.

Ritsuko:There seems no problem.  Riturn MAGI to the normal.

Misato: Dilenmma...

Ritsuko:The personality of the creater of these can be guessed.

Misato: What are you talking about?  Didn't you made this?

Ritsuko:You know nothing, aren't you?

Misato: It's because you are not talkative about yourself unlike me.

Ritsuko: Well, I just did system-up.  My mother made the basic theory and
        the body.

---------------------------------------
Fuyutsuki:Are you double checked on it?

Shigeru:Yes, sir.  It is the parts which were brought in three days ago.

Long Hair:This must be the parts where change is found.

Fuyutsuki:87th protein wall...

Long Hair: Some spots can be seen when enlarged.  What are those.

Glasses: Must be corrosion.  There are a small change in the tempareture and
        conductivity.  Deterioration of a sterilized room happens often,
        often recently.

Long Hair: The construction schedule was shortend by 60 days or so, so the
          air bubbles must have gotten in.  There are a lot of holes on the
          quality of the construction work of B Wing.

Fuyutsuki:That part was done after the Angels appeared, right?

Glasses: We cann't blame them.  Everyone is tired.

Fuyatsuki:Take care of it by tommorow.  Ikari will be picky about it otherwise.

------------------------------------------------
Ritsuko:Are water leaking again?

Maya:   No sir.  It is the corrosion of the walls above from here.

Ritsuko:Great.  Will it pose any trouble on the test?

Maya:   So far, no sir.

Ritsuko:Then continue.  This test cannot be aborted easily.  Commander Ikari
        will be bugging us, too.

Maya:   Understood.  Synchronized position on the normal.

Male Operater:Connecting the entry plug to EVA units through the simulation
        bodies.

Male Operater:Contact confirmed.

Female Operater: A.T. field are generated on 3 yokuto(spelling?).
# Is there anybody who know a name of unit for energy measurment 
# like Joct, Yogt, Yokt.

------------------------------------------
The spots on the wall starts growing.  Emagency call goes off.

Ritsuko: What happend?

Female Operater: Contermination alert on the Sigma Unit A Floor.

Male Operater: 87th wall is diteriorating, and releasing heat.

Male Operater: Abnormality found on the 6th pipe, too.

Maya:   Corrosion of the protein wall is spreading.  The speed is exprosive.

Ritsuko:Abort the test.  Shut down the 6th pipe.

Maya:   Understood.

Male Operater: 60, 38, 39, all were shutted down.

Male Operater: Corrosion found on 6-42.

Maya:   No effect. The corrosion spreads along the walls.

Ritsuko:Prepare Polysomes

Ritsuko:Lazer on the Max.  Fire at the invasion.

Maya:   The corrosion have reached 6-58. Coming!

(Angel's voice)

Rei:    No!

Ritsuko:Rei!

Maya:   Rei's sumilation body is moving!

Ritsuko:No way.

Maya:   Corrosion still spreading.  It is invading the active water system of
        the sumilation bodies.

Misato: How about Rei?

Maya:   She is OK.

Ritsuko: Eject all plug now.  Hurry the lazer

Misato: AT field!

Ritsuko:No way.

Misato: What... this?

Ritsuko:Analization pattern, blue.  It's the Angel, without any Questions.

Fuyutsuki:The Angel? Did you let the Angel to come inside?

Ritsuko: Sorry, sir.

Fuyutsuki:No excuse needed.  Close the Central Dogma.  Separate it from Sigma
        Unit.

Male Operater:Central Dogma, phsically closed down.  Separating it from Sigma
        Unit.

Misato:Abandon this Box.  Evacuate.

Operaters running.

Misato:What are you doing?  Hurry

Misato pull Ritsuko along with her.

Female Operater: Separating Sigma Unit from B Floor.  All partitions closing.
        Everyone on the area is to evacuate.

Gendou: I know. Please take care of it.

Gendow hungs up the phone

Gendou: Stop the alert.

Long Hair:S, stopping the alert, sir.

Gendou: It was a mistake.  The mistake of the detecter.  Tell Japan's
       government and the Commitee so.

Long Hair: Y, yes, sir.

Glasses:The contaminated area is still decending.

Fuyutsuki:It is on the bad place.

Gendou: Yes.  It is too close to the ADAM.

Gendou: Contain the corrosion by the Sigma unit.  You may sacrifice the Geo-
        Front.  How about EVA?

Glasses:Waiting at the 7th cage.  Can go as soon as the pilots are retreived.

Gendow: No need to wait for the pilots.  Just shoot them out to the surface
        as soon as preparations are done. 

Long hair and Glasses: What?

Gendou: Priority is the First Unit.  You may abandon the rest.

Glasses:The First Unit, sir? 

Long Hair:But sir, without EVA, we cannot destroy the Angel physically.

Gendou: If the EVA gets contaminated, we are completely finished.  Hurry!

Long Hair and Glasses:  Y, yes,sir.

Female Operater:Central Dogma under Sigma Unit will be completely sealed off
        in 60seconds.  30 seconds till the activation of the vaccume
        pump.

-----------------------------------------------
Ryouji: So, that is the Angel.  Can't do the work any more. Ha.

----------------------------------------------
Female Operater: Central Dogma, sealed completely off.  Mega-depth facilities
        are now completely taken over the invader.

Fuyutsuki:Now, how we make offence against the Angels without EVA?

EVANGELION

EPISODE:13

LILLIPUTIAN HITCHER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ritsuko: Look. Here is the boundery of heavy water, where more oxygen exists.

Maya:   Its preference is pretty clear.

Long Hair:The place where ozone is poured in to maintain sterilized condition
        is not contaminated.

Misato: So, does it mean its weakness is oxygen?

Ritsuko:Its seems like so.

Glasses:Injecting ozone.  Concentration increasing.

Long Hair:It is working, all right.

Fuyutsuki:Can we make it?

Maya:   0A and 0B seems to recovering.

Long Hair:Around the pipe is back to the normal.

Glasses:The center parts are tough as expected.

Fuyutsuki:OK, increase ozone.

Ritsuko:Something is wrong.

Long Hair:What? It is increasing.

Glasses:Something is wrong.  Heat release is increasing.

Long Hair:Conterminated area, increasing again

Maya:   The all effect of ozone is lost.

Glasses:Now, it is intaking ozone.

Ritsuko:Stop the ozone.

Ritsuko:Incredible.  It is evolving.

Misato: What's wrong.

Long Hair:Sub-computer is being hacked.  Hacker, unidentified.

# The appropriate word should be "cracked" rather than "hacked."
# And "cracker" rather than "hacker."

Glasses:Not now.  Dealing with C mode.

Long Hair: Unfreezing the barrier.  Decoy entry opened.

Male Operater: Decoy entry avoided.

Male Operater: 18sec. till trace completed.

Male Operater: Opening the barrier.

Male Operater: Barrier, broken.

Male Opreater: Opening more decoy entry.

Glasses:A human being cannot do this.

Male Operater:Tracing successful.  Hacker is within this facility.

Long Hair:Under the B-Wing.  It's Pribnow Box!

Maya:   The optical pattern is changing.

Long Hair:The growing lines are the electrical circuits.  It is a computer
        itself

Glasses:Opening decoy entry.  ...  Unsuccessful.  It was interfered.

Misato: Cut off the Main Cable.

Male Operater:It won't.  It won't take the order.

Misato: Shoot the lazer.

Maya:   AT field generated.  No effect.

Long Hair:It is accessing to the mainbank of the security.  It is operateing
        the passward.  12th diget, 16th deget. D word cleared.

Fuyutsuki:God!

Glasses:It is reading the mainbank.  Impossible to clear.

Fuyutsuki:What does it want?

Long Hair:It is searching the mainbank. This code is... No! It want to invade
        MAGI!

Gendou:Down the IO system.

Long Hair:Count down, please.

Glasses:3,2,1.

Glasses and Long Hair: Agh!

Glasses:Cannot be turned off!

Maya:   Angel, invading farther.  Contacting Melchior.
        It is about to take over.
        Melchior, reprogrammed by the Angel.

Voice:  Self-destruction suggested by AI Melchior.  Rejection, rejection, 
        rejection.

Long Hair:This time, Melchior is hacking Balthazar.

Glasses:Damn!  It's so fast!

Long Hair:What a caliculation speed!

Ritsuko: (taking a breath) Change the login mode.  Tune synchro-code to every
        fifteen minutes.

Glasses and Long Hair: Roger

Fuyutsuki:How long do we have?

Long Hair:Judging from the observations, about 2 hours.

Gendou: MAGI... against us.

---------------------------------------
Command Center.  No one is there.  The vidual of Angel is on

Ritsuko: They are micro-machines, the ANGELS with the size of virus.  The each
        of them gathers to form a colony, and in these short times, they have
        evolved expornentialy enough to from a intellegence circuit.

Fuyutsuki:Evolution...

Ritsuko: Yes, sir.  They constantly evolve themselves and look for the best way
        to cope with the situations.

Fuyutsuki:It is the system of survival of the life forms itself.

Misato: The only effective way to fight with subject which constantly evolve
        and over come its weakness is take it with us.  Only way is to MAGI to
        commit suicide and take it with MAGI.  I suggest physical elimination of
        MAGI.

Ritsuko:Impossible.  Aborting MAGI means aborting the Head Quater.

Misato:Then, I formally request it as the strategy section.

Ritsuko:I reject.  This is the matter of the engineering section.

Misato: Why are you acting like a mule.

Ritsuko:This situation started because of my mistake.

Misato: You've been always like that.  Keep everything to yourself and never
        depend on the others.

Ritsuko:As long as the ANGELS keeps evolution, we still have a chance.

Gendou:Promotion of the evolution?

Ritsuko:Yes, sir.

Gendou: The end of the evolution is self-destruction.  It is death itself.

Fuyutsuki:Then, what we should do is to promote evolution.

Ritsuko:If the ANGELS consider effective means of the survival, they may
        choose the co-existance with MAGI.

Glasses:But how?

Ritsuko:If the target is the computer itself, we can reverse hack by directly
        connecting Casper and the ANGELS, and by doing so, self-destruct 
        promotion code can be send in.  However...

Maya:   At the same time, we are opening up the barrier to the ANGELS.

Gendou: "Is Casper faster or the ANGELS faster?", right?

Misato: You can make the program by the time, right?  If Casper is taken over
        completely, that's it for us.

Ritsuko:I keep the promise.

MAGI on the screen

Female Operater:R Alert,  R Alert.  An emergency within the NERV HQ.  All
        emergency workers are to be evacuated.

Maya: (looking inside Casper) W, What are those?

Ritsuko:Scribbles by the developer(of this system.)

Maya: Oh gosh!  Those are the secret codes of MAGI!

Misato: Just like the map of the back door of MAGI.

Maya:   Owwww, am I allowed to see such a things?  Cann't believe it!  This is
        c of int!  With all these, we can program much faster than expected.

Ritsuko:Thanks, Mother.  We can make it for sure.

Ritsuko:Get me that wrench.

Misato:Reminds me of when we were in college.

Ritsuko:Board No.25.

Misato:Mmmmm will you tell me about MAGI?  Just a little?

Ritsuko:It's a long story.  But not much fan.  Do you know the personality
        transfer OS?

Misato: Yap.  It is the system to transfer a person's personality and make 
       the 7th generation organic computer to think by itself.  It is used
       to operate EVA, too.

Ritsuko:I heard MAGI is the first one to use it.  My mother developed it.

Misato: Did your mother's personality was transfered to MAGI?

Ritusko:Yes.

Ritsuko:In other word, these brains are my mother's.

Misato: Is that why you wanted to protect MAGI?

Ritsuko:I do not think so.  I did not like my mother much.  It is a decision
        as a scientist.

Glasses:Balthazar is now taken over.

Voice:  Self-destruction is now voted for by the AIs.  Self-destruction will be
        excuted 02sec. after all three are agreed about it.  The ranges of self-
        destruction is Geoid depth -280, -140, and 0 floor.  Due to the 
        activation of special rule 582, cancellation by the two of the AIs are
        impossible.

Misato: Is it begin?

Long Hair:Balthazar invading Casper farther.

Fuyutsuki:They are pushing us.

Glasses:What a speed!!

Voice:  Self-destruction in 20sec.

Fuyutsuki:Oh, no.

Long Hair:Casper will be taken over in 18sec.

voice:  Self-destruction in 15sec.

Misato: Ritsuko!  Hurry!

Voice:  Self-destruction in 10sec.

Ritsuko:Don't warry.  We are 1sec. ahead.

Voice:  Self-destruction in 9 sec.

Misato: A SECOND?

VOICE:  8

Ritsuko:Not zero, not negative. Maya.

Voice:  7,6,

Maya:   We can do it.

Voice:  5, 4, 3.

Ritsuko:Hit it.

Voice:  2, 1, 0.

Voice:  Self-destruction cancelled by AIs.

Glasses:Haha!

Long Hair:YES!

Maya and Misato: (Smiling Sighs)

Voice:  Now, special rule 582 is cleared.  MAGI system return to normal.

Ritsuko:Pfew!

Voice:  R Alert cleared.  R Alert cleared.  Everyone back to type one alert.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Entry plug, floating on a pond

Shinji: What is going on.

Asuka:  Yeee! I can't get out of here without any cloth!  Someone, help me FAST!

Maya:   Sigma Unit now released.  -03 till reopen of MAGI sistem.

Ritsuko:Am I too old for all-nighter already?

Misato: (handing a cup to Ritusko) Once again, you kept promise.  Good job.

Ritsuko:Thank you.  This is the fast time I felt the coffee you made is 
        delicious.

Misato: Hehehe.

Ritusko: A night before her death, my mother told me MAGI are three of herself.
        As a scientist, as a mother, and as a woman.  MAGI are three of those
        fighting each other.  She left dilemma of human being on purposely
        there.  To be honest, the program is slightly different from
        each other. Since I seem like not to be a mother,
        I cannot understand my mother as a mother.  But as
        a scientist, I respected her.  And as a woman, I even hated her.  

Misato: You speak a lot today.

Ritsuko:In Casper, pattern as a woman was input.   She stayed as a woman
        untill last.  It is jut like my mother.

                Translated Speech Script.

                Written by Kentaro ONIZUKA

                Revision Level 0.9
                

Here you go the script of Episode 14, which is almost the overview of
preceding 13 episodes. Part A is mainly consists of subtitles in
Japanese and the scenes from previous 13 episodes. I tried my best to
conserve the order of subtitiles. Well, it's tough work to conserve
the order, because the word order of Japanese is very different from
that of English. The fantasic and meaningful speech of Rei at the
begining of Part B has also many difficult points to translate. That's
a poem rather than a speech. Since the background scene is
synchronizing the speech, I had to conserve the word order strictly
here again.  As for the name of Angels, I tried to retrieve their
orthography.  I guess that the names are mainly from angel's in Hebrew
legends.  If you have information on the names in Hebrew legends,
please let me know.

        Complete silence.

------------

        Afterwards,

------------

        RUN TO WILD.

------------

        The interim report of
        "The city battle at Third New Tokyo"
        The responsible person,
        The planning manager Captain Katsuragi Misato

Misato: Although our damage resultant was terribly large,

------------

        The A.T. field of

Misato: the challenge of the unexperienced boy 
        to the first battle against the unknown target

------------

        the third Angel and Unit One
        was recognized.

Misato: and the fact that he carried out the challenge
        were indeed admirable deeds of Ikari Shinji.

------------

        Unit One,
        eroded the target's A.T. Field

Misato: However, for the section of planning, it was a hard
        battle that revealed further more problems and many
        points to improve.

# Misato's speech is in very formal and old style language.

------------

        Angel, Annihilated

------------

        Intercept installation, slightly damaged.
        Eva Unit One, middle scale damage.

------------

        The sufferers in the incident
        not being published.

------------

        Excerpted from Suzuhara Touji's composition

Touji:  My sister be's a sekond year student of primary.
        She be's injered in that insident.
        The injery ain't due to the enemy but to the wildy droid on our side.
        I no can forgive sucha fool story guy!
        I wanna make those adults he made the droid know my sister's
        pain and my anger.

# His composition is in Osaka-ben. Thus I translated into non-standard
# English.

        The fourth Angel

------------

        Shamusiel's
        attack

------------

        At that time,
        The performance ratio of        
        Surface-to-air intercept system,
        48.2%

------------

        The operation ratio of
        Third New Tokyo battle formation,
        96.8%

------------

        Douki Hikari's composition (part)

Hikari: Since I'd experienced the evacuation training a lot together
        with classmates, that was just like everyday matter,
        and I did not actually realize the situation.
        Boys were making noise as if they were on school excursion.
        We girls were not afraid of things.

------------

        Angel,
        Arriving at above Third New Tokyo.

------------

        The Second battle in Third New Tokyo.

------------

        Despite the accident of
        power-supply cutoff,

------------

        Angel, annihilated

------------

        NERV, obtained the sample
        of the angel with the original shape.

------------

        Yet, the final report
        of the analysis
        not being published

------------

        The Fifth Angel

------------

        Ramiel's attack

------------

        Against
        the hard-to-defeat target,

------------

        Captain Katsuragi's proposition,
        Operation Yashima,
        Approved

------------

        The First Qualified Child

------------

        The Exclusive Pilot of Eva Unit Zero

------------

        Ayanami Rei

------------

        Sortied on the Unsealed
        Eva Unit Zero for the first time.

------------

        The same day midnight,
        A component of the Angel,
        Invaded into the Geofront.

------------

        NERV,
        executed Operation Yashima.

------------

        Excerpted from Aida Kensuke's personal material

Kensuke:Ikari says nothing. But I am sure that at that time, Unit Zero
        protected Unit One for her life from the enemy's
        accelerated-particle-cannon attack.
        I am sure about that.
        It's because of only one reason.
        It's Ayanami.
        I have an impression that Ayanami regards herself as 
        a very weak existence.

------------

        Operation Yashima
        Successful.

Kensuke:Different from Pessimism,

Kensuke:But she already has something like that.

------------

        Eva Unit Zero Heavily Damaged

-----------

        However,
        the pilot survived

Kensuke:She seems more matured than us at the age 14 years old.

------------

        The sixth Angel

------------

        Gagiel

------------

        Encountered.

Committee:This incident is slightly out of the scenario.

Ikari:  Yet the result was within the predictable range.
        Possible to revise.

------------

        The Second Qualified Child

------------

        The Exclusive Pilot of Eva Unit Two

------------

        Souryu Asuka Langray

------------

        Sortied on Eva Unit Two
        for the first time

------------

        The close battle on the sea

------------

        And

------------

        The First Under-water Battle

------------

        In the battle around EX-Ito area

------------

        Angel, annihilated.


Committee: In the battle, UN navy lost one third of its whole ships.

Committee: The ships lost are those of your country.
        That's negligible.

Committer:Well yes. It was quite lucky once again that the damage was
        that small.

------------

        The Seventh Angel

------------

        Israfel's
        Attack

------------

        Having the capability of
        separation and combination

------------

        However,
        By the heavy synchronized two point attack
        by Eva Unit One and Two

------------

        Angel, annihilated

------------

        The Eighth Angel

------------

        Sandarphone

------------

        Discovered inside the
        crater of Mt. Asamayama

------------

        NERV,
        ordered Special Command A-17.

------------

        Carried out the capture operation
        under the ultimate priority condition.

------------

        Captured the target for a while
        in the electro-magnetic light wave cage.
        But...

------------

        The electro-magnetic barrier broken.
        The operation, canceled.

------------

        The objective of the operation
        changed to
        the Angel Annihilation.

------------

        Eva Unit Two
        carried out the operation

------------

        Angel, Annihilated.

------------

        Eva Unit Zero, restored from the damage
        And completed improvement

------------

        Returned to operational

------------

        The Ninth Angel

------------

        Matriel's
        attack

------------

        By the first simultaneous
        operation of three Eva Units

------------

        Angel, Annihilated

------------

        The Tenth Angel

------------

        Tzachqiel's
        attack

------------

        Against the target flying down
        from stratosphere

------------

        By the direct intercept
        by Three Eva Units,

------------

        Angel, Annihilated

------------

        The Eleventh Angel

------------

        Its attack not being recognized at the moment.

------------

        A rumour saying NERV headquarter
        directly invaded.

Committee: That's too bad.

------------

        The Instrumentality of Man Committee,
        Special Meeting

Committee: Too early.

Committee: Well yes. It is out of the prediction that an Angel
        invaded to the headquarter of NERV.

Committee: Addition to that, you allowed that to invade into Central Dogma.

Committee: If the contact had took place, all the plan would be in vain.

Ikari:  The report to this committee was a false report.
        There's no fact of the Angel's invasion.

Committee: Then, Ikari, you say, there's no fact of the Eleventh Angel's
        Invasion

Ikari:  That's right.

Committee: You should be careful about your speech, Ikari-kun.
        A perjurer in this committee shall die.

Ikari:  I allow you to investigate the log-record of Magi.
        Nothing concerning the incident was recorded.

Committee: Don't make us laugh!
        Concealing facts is one of your speciality.

Ikari:  The time schedule is going along the description in Scroll of
        Dead Sea.

Committee: Alright. This time, we don't claim your crime and responsibility.
        However, you don't have to write a new scenario.

Ikari:  I know.
        Let all things go according to Seele's scenario.

# "Seele" (ZE-RE). German word for "soul."
# But here it means an organization which carries out the plan written in 
# the Scroll of dead sea.

        WEAVING A STORY

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rei:    Mountain. Heavy is mountain.
        The thing that changes through a long time.
        Sky. Blue sky. The thing visible, the thing invisible.
        Sun. The thing unique.
        Water. the thing agreeable. Commander Ikari.
        Flowers. Many things alike. Many things useless.
        Sky. Red, Red sky. Red colour. Red colour that I hate.
        Water flow. Blood. the smell of blood. a woman that does not bleed.

Rei:    Made from red soil is a human.
        Made by a man and a women is a human.
        Town. The thing that human made.
        Eva. The thing that human made.
        Human is what? The thing that God made.
        Human is the thing that human made.
        The things that I own are life and mind.
        The vessel of mind. Entry plug, The throne of soul.

Rei:    Who is this? This is I.
        Who is I? What is I? What is I? What is I? What is I?

Rei:    I am myself. This object is I. The figure that forms me.
        I visible, though feel as if not I. Funny impression.
        My body seems like melting.
        I don't see myself. My figure is fading away.
        I am aware of someone else.
        Who is there in front of me?
        Ikari-kun.
        I know this guy. Major Katsuragi.
        Dr. Akagi.
        People, my classmate.
        Pilot of unit two.
        Commander Ikari.
        Who are you?
        Who are you?
        Who are you?

Ritsuko: How do you feel Unit One for the first time for you.

Rei:    It smells of Ikari-kun.

------------

        The first mutual compatibility test
        Examinee: Ayanami Rei

------------

Ritsuko:The synchro-ratio is almost the same as that to Unit Zero.

Maya:   The similar personal pattern is shared by Unit Zero and Unit One.

Ritsuko: That's why synchronization is possible.

Maya:   Error plus minus 0.03.
        Harmonics is regular.

Ritsuko:The compatibility between Rei and Unit One has no detectable
        problem.

Ritsuko: OK, Test complete. Rei, your job is over.

Rei:    Yes.

------------

        The 87th Unit synchronization test
        Examinee: Souryu Asuka Langray

------------

Announce: Data-bank of Unit Two, complete.

Announce: Harmonics regular.

Announce: Pilot, nothing abnormal.

Asuka:  Obviously.

------------

        The first mutual compatibility test
        Examinee: Ikari Shinji

------------

Ritsuko:Personal data of Unit Zero is..

Maya:   rewriting already complete. Currently re-confirming.

Ritsuko:Examinee's status?

Staff:  slightly strained, though no problem in the nerve pattern.

Misato: Unit Zero for the first time, because it's different Eva,
        it's reasonable.

Asuka:  He's a fool! He should relax himself ignoring such a thing.

Misato: Not such a child to do so is Shinji-kun.

Asuka:  I know. That's why he is a fool.

Misato: (laugh)

Asuka:  By the way, as for the two guys' unit compatibility test.
        Don't I have to participate that?

Misato: You will not want to get into other unit than Unit two.

Asuka:  Well, obviously, I won't.

Misato: Well, I've never heard of the unit two's compatibility.

Announce:Entry started.

Announce:LCL added.

Announce:Start first stage connexion.

Ritsuko:How do you feel the entry plug of Unit Zero.

Shinji: I Feel something strange.

Maya:   Do you feel incompatibility?

Shinji: No, I mean, it smells of Ayanami...

Asuka:  What's the smell? Abnormal is he!

Announce:Data received. Re-confirmation.

Announce:Pattern green.

Announce:Main power-supply connexion complete.

Announce:Every restriction no problem.

Ritsuko:Roger. Then mutual compatibility test moves to the second stage.

Maya:   Unit Zero entering into the second contact.

Misato: How is it?

Ritsuko: As I expected, smaller synchro-ratio than that to Unit one.

Maya:   Harmonics, all in regular position.

Ritsuko:But good readings.
        This means, we can carry out that plan.

Maya:   You mean Dummy system?
        I dare say to my senior, I am not so much...

Ritsuko:I understand why you don't want that.
        But, the preparation is always necessary, in order for one to live.

Maya:   I respect you, my senior. And I will do my job.
        Yet, I am not convinced enough.

Ritsuko:One with mysophobia always feels difficulty in living among people.
        When you get dirty, you will find that.

Announce:Third connexion started.

Announce:Self-psycho-graph, stable.

Asuka:  How do you feel like, Shin-chan! Mom's breast? or inside the womb?

Ritsuko:Asuka! don't disturb! noise would penetrate.

Asuka:  OK, Alright.

Asuka:  What's the hell. Everyone is indulgent to Shinji.

Ritsuko: A10 Nerve connexion started.

Announce: Harmonics Level plus 20.

Shinji: WOW, what's this?
        Something is entering directly into my head, what?
        Ayanami? Ayanami Rei? It's Rei, this impression is Rei's.
        Ayanami? Aren't you?

Misato: What's the matter?

Announce:Pilot's nerve-plus in irregular.

Maya:   Psychological pollution is taking place.

Ritsuko:Unbelievable! This plug depth does not trigger that.

Maya:   No, Not from the plug. The invasion from Eva.

Maya:   Unit Zero, out of control!

Ritsuko:Cut all circuit! Cut power-supply!

Announce:Eva switched to backup power source.

Announce:Still operating.

Misato: Shinji's status?

Staff:  Circuit no carry. Monitoring impossible.

Ritsuko:Unit Zero rejects Shinji-kun?

Maya:   No! Automatic Ejection non operational.

Ritsuko:The same incident as that time?
        Trying to possess Shinji-kun?

Misato: Rei! Go back! Rei!

Announce:Unit Zero, 10 second to stop operation, 9, 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0

Announce:Unit Zero stopped operation.

Misato: Rescue the Pilot! Hurry!

Misato: Is it that Eva tried to kill Rei? That Unit Zero tried?

-----------------------

Misato: This incident has something to do with that incident of going wild?
        That incident of Rei?

Ritsuko: Nothing I can say at the moment. One thing I can say at the moment
        is, after returning the personal data of Rei to Unit Zero,
        another synchronization test between Rei and Unit Zero is necessary.

Misato: As the planning manager, I request you to do it immediately,
        before that troubles our job.

Ritsuko:I know. Major Katsuragi.

Ritsuko: It must be me that Unit Zero tried to attack.
        No doubt.

------------------------------

Shinji: Uh.

Radio:  The next astonishing in the world, is a doggy who can calculate.
        Hi! Here you go, the genius doggy, Kanna-chan! 
        ONE!
        Good greetings!
        Do you understand language?
        ONE!
        Oh, that's right!
        ONE!
        Then, please solve the problem.
        325 minus 324 is
        ONE!
        Oh! Great! It is correct!

# Japanese dog barks "WAN, WAN" instead of "BOW WOW", thus "one one"

Shinji: Oh, No! I hate this ceiling.
------------

Staff:  Shinji-kun has recovered consciousness.
        No remaining aftereffect from the pollution.
        He himself remembers nothing.

Misato: Is that so.

-------------------------------------
Radio:  The problem of Nansha islands ...

Asuka:  Neither Misato nor Kaji-san tell me nothing.
        Shinji knows nothing.
        What kind a girl is FIRST ?

--------------------------------------
Fuyuzuki:The Angel's invasion which is out of the plan.
        The push from The Instrumentality of Man Committee who found
        the fact.
        They are mean people. Complaining  is their only job to do.

Ikari:  All the trump cards are ours. They can do nothing.

Fuyuzuki:That does not mean, you should irritate them.

Ikari:  Everything is going according to the scenario. No problem.

Fuyuzuki:What is that Unit Zero's accident. That was not in my scenario.

Ikari:  Nothing interfering.
        The synchro test between Rei and Unit Zero after that
        was successful.

Fuyuzuki:He is taking care of Rei too much. Ikari...

Fuyuzuki:How is the status of Adam Project.

Ikari:  No problem. The delay is less than 2%.

Fuyuzuki:Then, how about Lancea Longini (Longinus'es Lance)?

Ikari:  Going along the plan. The operation is carried out by Rei.

---Will be continued---

                Directly to me.
                Much irritated.
                Finaly he implied your dismiss.

Ikari:          Adam is going well. As for Eva project, we've started

Fuyuzuki:       The most important, The Project of Mankind Intrumentality 
                is behind the schedule.

Ikari:          All the projects are coupled together.
                No problem.

Fuyuzuki:       You also mean Rei?
                Alright.
                By the way, how shall we deal with that guy?

Ikari:          Let him do as he likes.
                Same as the Marduk Institute.

Fuyuzuki:       We may make use of him for a while.

PhoneResponder: Hello. This is Kanji's. I am out at the moment.
                If you have something, please leave your name and message.

Asuka:          WOW, Help me Kaji-san! What are you doing to me.
                Abnormal! AAAAAA!
                Phew. 

Hikari:         What happened?

Asuka:          I've wanted Kaji-san to take me somewhere Sunday tomorrow.
                And I phoned, though he's been absent for long.
                These days, he's been always out.

Hikari:         That means, you have nothing to do tomorrow.

Asuka:          I am very sorry but that's right.

Hikari:         Then, I have one thing to ask you.

Asuka:          What?

Hikari:         I mean..

Asuka:          Oh! Date?

Hikari:         That's a friend of my sister Kodama.
                He ask me saying "You must introduce her to me!"

Ritsuko:        On which dress will you have tomorrow?

Misato:         Oh, you mean the wedding party?
                I had on that suits in pink at Kiyomi's party.
                I just recently had on that dress in navy-blue at Kotoko's.

Ritsuko:        How about that orange one?
                You don't have on that these days.

Misato:         Oh, that one. That has a slight reason to...

Ritsuko:        Too tight?

Misato:         That's right.
                Phew.
                Should I buy new one on the way home?
                That will cost a lot.

Ritsuko:        We've been invited so frequently that the amount of 
                gratuity is that big.

# The invited person has to give a gratuity to the couple in Japan.
# The amount is about 20,000 YEN (200 US$) or more.

Misato:         Shit! Every one is eager to marry before they get
                thirty years old.

Ritsuko:        We don't want to be the last one remaining single.

Ritsuko:        OK! your job is over.

Ritsuko:        You did it.

Asuka:          Always test, test, that I cannot enjoy!

Ritsuko:        By the way, he is much depressed today, Shinji-kun is.

Misato:         'Cose it's tomorrow.

Ritsuko:        Well, it's tomorrow.

---------------------------------------------

Shinji:         I am going to meet my father tomorrow.
                What do you think I shall talk about with him?

Rei:            How come you ask me such a thing?

Shinji:         'cose I saw you enjoy talking with my father the other day. 

Shinji:         Hey, what kind of man is my father?

Rei:            I have no idea.

Shinji:         Is that so.

Rei:            Is it because you've wanted to ask it that you've
                been staring at me since daytime?

Shinji:         Yeah.

Shinji:         Oh, when we were cleaning room today, you were wringing
                the floorcloth.
                You looked like a mother at that time.

Rei:            a mother?

Shinji:         Yeah.
                Yeah, that was just like the mother's way of wringing.
                I bet you become a housewife.
                (Laugh).

Rei:            What do you say!

---------------------------------------------

TV:             Oh, no! It's you that said "we should separete."

Misato:         I'm back.

TV:             .... maybe .....

Asuka:          Hi.

TV:             What are you saying in such a situation.
                I don't know about you, but I am different from what I was
                in those days.

Misato:         Go to bed right now, because You are going to date tomorrow.

TV:             Yet I still love...

Asuka:          Yeah, with a MD student.
                Oh, I've got it. Hey, may I use that? Your perfume of lavender.

Misato:         NO!

TV:             Once .... woman cannot return to what she was.
                I cannot return to what I was in those days.

Misato:         Shit. You stingy guy!

TV:             But I still love you.

Misato:         That's not for you, a child.
                Shinji-kun is in his room?

TV:             I told you it's impossible.

Asuka:          He's been shutting himself for long.
                It seems that he doesn't wanna see his father.
                If he hates, he must say he doesn't want that.
                Japanese people are such a ..

TV:             I'd been trying to forget you for three years.

Misato:         It is not that he really hate that.

TV:             Don't say such a thing now.

Misat:          That's indeed a problem.
-------------------------------
Ikari:          Go home!

Ikari:          Good job, Shinji.

Misato:         Shinji-kun, I open.

Misato:         You are afraid of that? To be with your father alone?
                It's no good to always escape.
                You must go one step further.
                Otherwise nothing will change.

Shinji:         I know.

Misato:         You are going to know,
                Not only the first step, but also you have to continue
                to step after the first one.
                Anyhow, you must go there with the strong mind tomorrow,
                since you will meet your mother.

Misato:         Then, g'night.

-----------
Asuka:          Hey, you bought a dress for tomorrow? Let me see!

Misato:         (laugh), you wanna see? Very expensive one.

Asuka:          That's a sense rather than a price.

Misato:         Here it is. This is perfect!

Asuka:          Yeah! Do you take Kaji-san's taste into account?

Misato:         I must not. It was over long ago.

------------------------------------------------
Misato:         Then,

Asuka:          I'm

Shinji:         Off.

Speech:         From now on, you must keep three bags in your mind, and ...

        Mr. Kaji Ryouji

Ritsuko:        Yet, he's not come. Ryou-chan.

Misato:         That idiot's never come on time.

Ritsuko:        It was when he dated.
                His attitude was different when on job.

Ryouji:         Hi! you two are ever more beautiful today.      
                I failed to escape from job before the time.

Misato:         But you are always idling.

Ryouji:         (Laugh)

Misato:         Anyhow, why don't you shave that sloppy beard? 
                And the tie is not set correctly.

Ryouji:         Sorry.

Ritsuko:        You two look like spouses.

Misato:         Uh!

Ryouji:         Good point! Ritchan.

Misato:         Who marries this kind a guy!

-------------------------------------------------------
Ikari:          It's been three years since last time to be here 
                with you alone.

Shinji:         Since I escaped at that time, I've never come here.
                I don't feel like my mother sleeps here.
                I don't remember my mother's face.

Ikari:          People continue to live by forgetting things.
                Nevertheless, we have something that we must not forget.
                Yui let me know the indispensable thing.
                To confirm that, I come here.

Shinji:         Don't you have something like her photo?

Ikari:          Nothing remains.
                This grave is nothing but a decoration.
                No remains.

Shinji:         As the teacher says, you casted everything.

Ikari:          Everything is in my mind.
                I am satisfied by that at the moment.

-----------
Ikari:          It's time. I leave.

Shinji:         Father!
                I mean, I am glad today, that I had a time to talk with you.

Ikari:          Is that so.

NEON
GENESIS
EVANGELION

EPISODE: 15

Those women longed for the touch of other's lips, and thus invited
their kisses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji:         uh?

Asuka:          Not bad!

Asuka:          You have such a thing?

Shinji:         I've been learning since I was five, and this skill.
                I am not particulartly talented.

Asuka:          Continuation is power.
                I slightly think better of you.

Shinji:         I began this following my teacher's advise.
                I could have quited immediately.

Asuka:          Then, why have you continued?

Shinji:         No one stopped me.

Asuka:          That figures.

Shinji:         You come back early. I thought you would have a supper.

Asuka:          It was not a fun to be with that boy.
                So, I escaped while we were in the queue
                for the roller coaster.

Shinji:         That's too cold.

Asuka:          Oh! Only Kaji-san is the normal man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato:         It's too late to say such a thing.
                I'll fix my hear.

Ryouji:         But don't escape.

Misato:         Beeee.

Ryouji:         Pumps...

Ryouji:         It's been long since we, three, drinked last?

Ritsuko:        She drinked too much.
                She looks frolicking.

Ryouji:         To keep oneself from frolicking, one drinks again.
                Well, today, it's not me but her.

Ritsuko         But the word from the man who have lived together is
                quite heavy.

Ryouji:         I lived together, though it had been before Katsuragi had on
                pumps.

Ritsuko:        We never imagined that during the school days.

Ryouji:         I was a kid, so, that was not a life of a man and a woman,
                but a room-sharing. Yeah, that was a kid's play.

Ryoji:          Oh, here you go. A souvenir from a cat.

Ritsuko:        Oh, thanx.
                What a honest man you are. 

Ryouji:         To ladies.
                But sloven to business. 

Ritsuko:        I doubt.
                To Misato?

Ryouji:         I lost once. It's not my policy to fight
                a war that I'm sure to lose.

Ritsuko:        I think you have a chance to win.

Ryouji:         To win Ritchan?

Ritsuko:        It's not my policy to talk about myself.
                Nothing amusing.

Ryouji:         She's not yet back. Katsuragi might be making her up?

Ritsuko:        What were you doing in Kyoto?

Ryouji:         It's Matsushiro, that the souvenir is from.

Ritsuko:        It's no use pretending. 
                Too much investigation will result in a burn.
                This is an advise from a friend.

Ryouji:         I listen to you seriously.
                But, if I get burnt, I wish that by the love-play of fire
                with you.

Misato:         Shall I buy some fireworks for you?

Ryouji:         Oh, you are back.

Misato:         You've never changed that attitude.

Ryouji:         Oh, yes, I am changing. To live is to change.

Ritsuko:        Homeostasis and transistasis.

Misato:         What are those?

Ritsuko:        The power to conserve the present status, and the power
                to change.
                The things which have those two contradictory things are
                living things.

Ryouji:         Those are men and women.

Ritsuko:        I leave now.
                I have a job left to do.

Misato:         You really leave?

Ritsuko:        Yeah.

Ryouji:         I am very sorry.

Ritsuko:        ciao.

Misato:         ciao.

-----------------------
Phone(Misato):  Is that you Shinchan? This is me.
                I am drinking with Kaji-kun.
                Yeah, in the third time party.

# If you drink with some body who participated that party,
# the drinking is called "Second time party."
# And if you drink after the second time party,
# the drinking is Third time party.

Shinji:         hm, hm, alright. bye.

Asuka:          Misato?

Shinji:         Yeah. She said she will be back very late.
                and said "go to bed before I'm back"

Asuka:          Oh! Is it that she is coming back tomorrow morning?

Shinji:         I don't think so, because she is with Kaji-san.

Asuka:          You idiot! It's because of that.


--------------------------------------------
Misato:         wwww.

Ryouji:         You are old enough. Don't throw up.

Misato:         Sorry that I am old enough.

Ryouji:         I'm old enough as well.

Misato:         That's right.

Ryouji:         You are having on pumps. I feel that long time.

Misato:         You'd better shove your sloppy beard.

Ryouji:         alrigh'

Misato:         OK, I walk from here. Thanks.

Ryouji:         hm.

Misato:         Kaji-kun, Have I changed?

Ryouji:         You've got pretty.

Misato:         I am sorry that I insisted to separate at that time.
                I told you that I had another one to love,
                yet it was a lie.
                Did you find that?

Ryouji:         No.

Misato:         I found, I found that you had something that resembled to my
                father.
                I was looking for the appearence of my father. When I found
                that, I feared. I feared everything.
                I feared to be with you.
                I feared to be a woman. I feared everything.
                Although I'd hated my father,
                I happened to love a man looking like my father.

Misato:         To forget everything, I joined NERV, which, however, was an
                institute at that my father had been.
                I have been pretending to revenge Angels.
                Phew.

Ryouji:         It is you that chose that way.
                You don't have to apologize to me.

Misato:         No! I did not choose that way. I just tried to escape.
                I just tried to escape from my father's spell.
                Just like Shinji-kun.
                I am cowardly.
                I am sorry. 
                Tonight, I'm speaking this kind a thing because I am drunk.
                
Ryouji:         That's enough.

Ryouji:         I am a kid. I have no right to say nothing to Shinji-kun.

Ryouji:         That's enough.

Misato:         And moreover, I try to depend on a man only in such a situation
                like this. I am a foul woman.
                At that time, I might have made use of you.
                I hate myself!

Ryouji:         That's enough! Stop!

Misato:         I despair of myself!
                uuh...

------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:          Hey, Shinji, let's kiss.

Shinji:         E? what?

Asuka:          I mean kiss. Kiss. You have never kissed?

Shinji:         No.

Asuka:          Then, let's kiss.

Shinji:         Hm.. How come?

Asuka:          Because I have nothing to do.

Shinji:         Nothing to do, so, kiss? It's ...

Asuka:          You don't want to kiss a girl in the anniversary of
                your mother's death?
                You are afraid that your mother might watch us
                from the heaven?

Shinji:         I don't care.

Asuka:          Or, you fear to kiss?

Shinji:         I don't. I can kiss.

Asuka:          Have you brushed teeth?

Shinji:         yeah.

Asuka:          Then here you go.

Asuka:          Your nose-breath is ticklish. Don't breathe.

Shinji:         Guwaa.

PenPen:         kwawaa wa wa hya.

Shinji:         gwaaa

Ryouji:         Hey, here we arrived. Cheer up!

Misato:         Phew, hard.

Ryouji:         OK, I leave.

Asuka:          How about staying here tonight?

Ryouji:         People will laugh at me if I go office in this suits.

Asuka:          Nothing matters. It's OK!
                Hey! Kaji-san!

Asuka:          He smells of lavender.

Ryouji:         I'm sorry. but take care of Katsuragi. 

Shinji:         Alright.

Ryouji:         OK, g'night.

Shinji:         Good night.

Shinji:         What's the matter? You seem depressed.

Asuka:          Because I kissed a guy like you!

Ryouji:         Hi! how is the aftereffect of drinks.

Misato:         Thanks to this, now that I am completely clear.

Ryouji:         That's nice.

Misato:         Is this your true job?
                Or part-time job?

Ryouji:         I wonder which.

Misato:         The person belonging to the special section of inspection,
                of the special institute NERV is Kanji Ryouji,
                at the same time, you are a person belonging to
                the inquiry section of the Japan's ministry of interior,
                Kaji Ryouji.

Ryouji:         Oh, you've found that.

Misato:         Don't hold NERV cheap!

Ryouji:         Is this ordered by Commander Ikari?

Misato:         On my own accord. If you do this part-time job further,
                you shall die.

Ryouji:         Commander Ikari makes use of me. I can go further.
                Anyhow, I am sorry that I've kept this thing secret from you.

Misato:         Since I appreciate your yesterday's matter,
                I allow you about that.

Ryouji:         Thanx.
                However, Commander and Ritchan also have something kept
                secret from you.
                That is this!

Misato:         This is...
                Eva?...
                No,..
                Is this...

Ryouji:         Yes. The key of the Second Impact and everything after that,
                and the starting point of everything. This is Adam.

Misato:         Adam?
                That first Angel is here?
                Well, NERV is less cheaper than I've held

Asuka:  (humming)

Misato : mmm...,oh,Shin-chan,you changed the soup stock,didn't you?

Shinji : Yes,stock of dried bonito. That's Ritsuko-san't souvenir.

Asuka : Eek!

Asuka : Too hot!!

Shinji : I'm sorry.

Asuka : grr...you always begs so.Do you think you're really wrong?

Shinji : hmm...

Asuka : Shinji,it seems you beg as a conditional reflex not to be scolded.
 
Shinji :ah,I'm sorry.

Asuka : Like you did. You're essentially too self-punishing.

Misato : Oh,oh.That's Shin-chan's life-style.
 
Asuka : You're optimistic to accept his lifestyle.
        Lately,you're too soft on Shinji,aren't you?
        
Misato : Me?

Asuka : You recovered the frendship with Kaji-san, but you shouldn't 
        give us your happiness.
        
Misato : I have nothing to do with that Kaji.

Ryouji (voice from the telephone) :
        "Hey,Katsuragi,I found the pub that serves good beverages.
        How about tonight?Thank you."
        
Misto : Ou,Ouch.

Asuka : I know I've never gone around together in such dirty relationship.
        Heck, you pretend to show yourself as a guardian.
        Hypocrytic! I hate that!!

(In the Entry Plug)

Misato :Can you hear me,Shinji-kun?

Shinji :hmm..ah, Misato-san! How is the result of the test?

Misto :Yeah! YOU ARE NUMBER ONE!

Shinji : huh!

--
Asuka :I'm beaten!
        He easily exceeds me!
        'cause he did it such easily, to be frank, I feel a bit vexing.
        Great,wonderful, strong, too strong!
        huh! Undefeatable Shinji-sama!
        Now that our job will be easier, won't it?
        But, we have to do our best not to be left behind.
        
Rei :Good bye.

Operator(male) : Target advancing slowly. 2.5 km per hour.

Ritsuko : You're late!

Misato : Ah, sorry.
        What's going on? The observation centre of Mt.Fuji did ...
        
Shigeru : ...not detect it.It suddenly appeared right above.

Makoto :Pattern orange. A.T.Field not detected.

Misato : What does it mean?

Ritsuko : Is it the new kind of Angels?

Maya : MAGI doesn't commit the dicision.

Misato :Oh no. Commander Ikari is absent in this situation!

--
(three Evangelions are standing by)
Misato :Can you hear me?
        Target's data are those I've sent.
        Presently, we don't have further data.
        Approach carefully, watch its reaction,
        and If possible, lead it to outside the urban area.
　　　　　
Asuka : Alright, sensei.
        I think Shinji-kun must be the van.
        
Shinji :ah,huh?

Asuka : well,in any case,
        This is a job for a man of good record, daring and the number
         one of the Syncro-rate.
         Or do you have no confidence,Shin-chan?
         
Shinji :No! I am ready to do!

Asuka : mmm...

Shinji :I'll show a good example for you,Asuka.

Asuka :Wh,Wh,What do you mean!

Misato :Hey ,guys ....

Shinji :You told me,"YOU ARE NUMBER ONE".

Misato :Oh, that was ..

Shinji :(interupting Misato) To fight is manly job.

Asuka :Anachronistic!
        Unit two, backup.
        
Rei :Unit Zero acts as backup, too.

Misato :My kids do that, without my permission.

Ritsuko : Shinji-kun developped much,didn't he?

Misto :No. I must scold him when he returns.

Ritsuko :You might be a good teacher.
--
Shinji :Ayanami,Asuka.How about your configurations?

Rei :Not Yet.

Asuka :You know Eva can't move that fast.

(Eva-02's umbilical cable is caught at the building.
 Asuka pueges cable and inserts another one to the back of Eva-02)

Asuka : Shit!

Asuka : Oof!

Shinji : You don't come?
        (I try to prevent it to leaving.)
        
--
Ritsuko : It vanished!

Misto :What?

--
Makoto :Pattern blue. Angel detected. Right below Unit One.

Shinji :What? Sh, Shadow! Ah,huah!
        What's this! 
        Strange!
        
Misato :Run, Shinji-kun, run!

Rei : Ikari-kun.

Asuka :You fool,what are you doing!

-
Shinji :hoah,whoa!
        Misato-san, what's going on? Misao-san!
        Asuka, Ayanami, cover me!
        Misato-san,can you hear me,Misato-san!
        
Misato : hm. Eject plug! Send signal!

Maya :No response.
-
Shinji :Misato-san, Misato-san!

-
Misato :Shinji-kun!

-
Misato :Asuka, Rei. Rescue Unit One. Hurry up!

Asuka :(Fool! It's no use of perfect record on the examination-only!)
-
Maya :It vanished again.

Ritsuko :Asuka, be careful!

-
Asuka :Shadow!?

Asuka :No!

(buildings sink in the black "shadow".)

Asuka :What? City is ...

Misato :Asuka, Rei. withdraw!

Asuka :hm, wa..

Rei : Wait!

Asuka :huh?

Rei : Unit One and Ikari-kun are still inside.

-
Misato :You are ordered! withdraw!

--
Maya : Major Katsuragi must feel pain.

Ritsuko : I hear that Umbilical Cable was pulled up but
          it lost its head.
          
Maya : That means...

Ritsuko : Energy remained withi the internal battery is little.
          If Shinji-kun won't blindly move Eva and
          if he can endure with life-support mode,
-
          he can survive for 16 hours.
--
Operator (male A) : Second  tank squadron, arrange completed.

Operator (female) : Roger. Keep the present position and stand by.

Shigeru : UN Force's seiging is complete.

Misato : that Shadow's status?

Makoto : not moving. It seesed the motion when it exceeded 600 meter in 
        diameter. But land troop is useful?

Misato : It intends to give us pressure.

Asuka : Oh well,
-
        Acting arbitrarily without consultation, defying the operation.
        It's the consequence of his own fault.
        He made good result on yesterday's test,
        though he said, "I'll show a good example", huh, what a 
        frivolous boy he is!
        
Asuka : Wh, What?
        Does abusing Shinji makes you so unpleasant?
        
Rei : Do you get on Eva to be praised by somebody?

Asuka : No. I wanna be praised not by somebody but by myself!

Misato : Stop, you people.
        Yes, he acted arbitrarily without consultation.
        So I'll have to scold him when he's back.

Shinji : I never thought sleeping exhausts me.
         (Shinji activates monitor.)
         Still only white noise.
         
　　　　Rader and sonar has gotten no response.
　　　　
　　　　Because this space is too vast.
　　　　
　　　　12 hours after I switched to the life-support-mode. Huh...
　　　　
　　　　My life will end in 4 or 5 hours.
　　　　
　　　　..feel hungry.
　　　　
 --
Misato : You mean, that shadow portion is the Angel's body ?

Ritsuko : Yes, about 680 meter in diameter, about 3 nano meter in 
         thickness. It sustains that super-thin space with the 
         inverted A.T.Field, and the interior of the Field is the 
         imaginary space called "Dirac's Sea."
         It may connect to another space.
         
Misato : What's that sphere?

Ritsuko : It vanishes when the imaginary circuit of the body closes.
        The object in the sky is nothing but a shadow.

Misato : It means the black shadow that introjected Unit One is the target?

Asuka : Then we have no way to do against it.

--
Shinji : Mm...
        Water is getting muddy! Hug.
        Purification capacity is reducing.
        
　　　　Hah. M,m.. it smells.
　　　　　
　　　　blood, smells of blood.
　　　　
　　　　Ha, No! I hate this place!
　　　　
　　　　Why can't I release this lock!
　　　　
　　　　Open! Let me out!
　　　　
　　　　Misato-san!! What's going on, Misato-san!
　　　　
　　　　Asuka! Ayanami!! Eee! Ritusko-san! hug,
　　　　
　　　　Father, hug, cough, m, g, mm,
　　　　
　　　　Please, help me.

Misato : Forced salvaging Eva ?
 
Ritsuko : It's the only way that might be possible.

        Dropping 992 existing NN depth charges  to the centeral portion,
        in timing with,
        interfering the imaginary circtuit of the Angel in 1 mili second
        with two existing  Eva's A.T. Fields.
        
　　　　In that moment, concentrating the explosive energy,
　　　　to break the Angel together with Dirac's Sea 
　　　　that forms its body.
　　　　
Misato : But, you know, how Eva's body, eee,
        will be. Heck, 
        It's not the rescue operaion.
        
Ritsuko : In this operation, salvage of the body of Unit One 
        is the number one priority over everything.
        We don't care if the body is destroyed.
         
Misato : Hah, wait a moment!

Ritsuko : In this case, we don't care the pilot's life.

Misato : Mgg.

(Misto slaps Ritsuko)

Ritsuko : Aw!

Ritusko : Oh, it's your fault if you lose Shinji-kun. Huh, remember that.
        
Misato : What's the reason why you and the commandor Ikari
        stick on the Unit One ?
        Huh, what is Eva ?
        
Ritsuko : The materials I gave you tells you all about Eva.

Misato : You are liar.

Ritsuko : Trust me, Misto.
        I'll command anything about this operation. 
        
Ritsuko : We'll forward flights to the Kankuu airport.
        Contact the air controll and the air transport division
        of the JDAF.
        
 Misato : (thinking) Second Impact, Project Instrumentality, and Adam.
        There're more secrets that I am ignorant of.

 (In the Entry Plug)

Shinji : Who? 
        Who?
        
Shinji ' : IKARI Shinji.

Shinji : It's me.

Shinji ' : I am you.
          One has another self inside within oneself.
          The Self is always consisted of two selves.

Shinji : Two ?

Shinji ' : The self who's actually watched by others and 
         the self who wathces itself.
         IKARI Shinji in your mind.
         IKARI Shinji in KATSURAGI Misato's mind.
         IKARI Shinji in Souryuu Asuka's mind.
         IKARI Shinji in AYANAMI Rei's mind.
         IKARI Shinji in IKARI Gendou's mind.
        Any IKARI Shinji is differnt from each other,
        but each of them is true IKARI Shinji.
        You're afraid of IKARI Shinji in other's mind.
        
Shinji : I'm afraid of being hated.

Shinji : You hate to be hurted.
        Who's bad ?
        Father is bad.
        Father who deserted me.
        
Shinji : I am bad.

-
(flashback)

Asuka : This way you always think yourself bad!
        That is "self-punishing."

-
(flashback)

Shinji : Heck, it's me who can do nothin'.

Misato :It's you that think you can do nothing?

-
(flashback)

Rei : Don't you trust your father ?

(flashback)

Shinji : (thought) I think I hate father. But I'm not sure.

(flashback)

Gendou : Well done, Shinji.

Shinji : Father called me by my name.
        I was praised by that my father.
        
Shinji ' : You'll live with chewing the cub of the pleasure.

Shinji : If I trust this word, heck, I can live on from now on.

Shinji ' : ... by deceiving yourself ?

Shinji : Everyone does so. Huh,
        Doing so, people live.
        
Shinji ' : Unless you continue to think you may not change yourself,
         you can't live on.
         
Shinji : There're too many pains in this world for me to live.
        
Shinji ' : For example, you cannot swim ? 

Shinji : Human isn't made floatable.

Shinji : It's self-decetion.

Shinji : I don't care whatever you refer to it.

Shinji : You has been closing your eyes and turning your ears deaf 
        against anything you did not want to know.

(flashback from the episode 3)

Kensuke : Sorry, but his younger sister was ...

(flashback from the episode 4)

Misato : This is not your business to care others!

(flashback from the episode 1 )

Gendou : Get Out!
-
Shinji : No, I don't want to hear that!

Shinji' : Hey, you run away again.
        No one  can live on with linking things one enjoys like 
        the rosary.
        Particularly, I cannot.
        
Shinji : I found one thing I enjoy.
        Am I wrong if I do the thing enjoyable?
--
Makoto : Theoretically, reserved power source of the Entry Plug
         will nearly end.
         
Maya : Life support system of the Plug Suit will be in red zone.

Ritsuko : We shall bring the schedule 12 minutes forward.
        while Shinji-kun is likely to be alive.
        
--
Shinji : Father,
        Am I a useless child ?
        Father!!
        
Shinji : It's from your side that you ran away.

Shinji : I hate this place,
        and loneliness.

　　　　　The circulation of Oxygen ended here.
　　　　　
　　　　　Fu, Fu, F, it's cold.
　　　　　
　　　　　Fuah, No, Suit reaches its margin.
　　　　　
　　　　　Now the end, hah, tired, haah, of everything.
　　　　　
Shinji : Mam.

(flashback ?)

Yui : Is it enough?
     Well, that's good for you.

Shigeru : Both of Evas, stand by the operating position.

Maya : Ready to generate A.T.Field.

Ritsuko : Roger.

Makoto : 60 seconds to bombing.

-
(with the rumbling of the ground, "shadow" on the earth cracks.)

Asuka : What's going on?

-
Misato : Status?

Makoto : No information.

Maya : All meters take full swing.

Ritsuko : But nothing have we done.

Misato : Oh! Shinji-kun is ...

Ritsuko : Unbelievable. The energy within Unit One has reached zero point.

-
( the "sphere" in the sky suddenly splits and the bloody fingers 
 appears from the interior ...)
 
Misato and other people : Ah!

Unit One : (Splitting the "sphere"...) GWOOOOOOOO.....

-
Asuka : Am, Am I riding the thing like that ?

-
Ritsuko : What, what thing we copied from ...

Misato : (thought) I understand that EVA isn't just a copy of 
        the First Angel, though, how is NERV going to use EVAs
        after it defeats all Angels ?
        
-
Unit One : Ggwoooooooo.....

--
(After that, Misato opens the Entry Plug)

Misato : Shinji-kun, Shinji-kun, Shinji-kun!

-
        Shinji-kun, are you alright ? Shinji-kun!!
        (weep)
        
Shinji : ... I just wanted to see ..... again .....

Misato : (weeps)

Asuka : Didn't you say you would scold him ?

Misato : (weeps)

-
(in the cage, workers washing EVA )

Ritsuko : I've never felt Eva more horrible than today.
        Is EVA truely our side ?
        It may hate us.
        Major KATSURAGI may be aware of something.
        
Gendou : I see. At the moment, it's OK.

Ritsuko : If Rei and Shinji-kun know the secrets of EVA,
        they may will never forgive us.

(In a sickroom , Shinji wakes up. Rei is by his side.)

Shinji : Ho-hum.

Rei : You may sleep today. We'll do thing for you.

Shinji : Hm. But, I'm alright now.

Rei : Well, that's good for you.

Shinji : Huh ...

(Rei goes out the room. Asuka is hiding behind the door.)

Asuka : ah, oh! Mmm ...

Shinji : (chuckles)

Shinji : (sniff)

Shinji : still smells, of blood.

                Translated Speech Script.

                Written by Kentaro ONIZUKA

Introduction,

Hmmmm, "Eva" is going darker and darker, bl..dier and bl..dier, more
and more serious. By the last episode, every one may die.  As the
result, the earth becomes the stage of battle among Eva Units and Angels,
where only one person remaining is Gendo.
# This is my guess.

Kihl:   You rejected the interrogation to the only person concerned to
        the incident this time, the pilot of the unit one.
        Major Katsuragi.

Misato: Yes.
        His emotion is very unstable.
        I don't think it's a good idea that he stands here at the moment.

A:      Then, I ask you, as his deputy, Major Katsuragi.

B:      In this incident, isn't it that the Angels tried to contact a human 
        being.

Misato: The report from the experiencee does not suggest that.
        Presumably, it was an irregular incident.

C:      As long as he remembers correctly.

Misato: No exterior operation to his memory was recognized.

C:      Eva's AC recorder was not operating.
        No way to confirm that.

A:      Was the Angel interested in the human spirit and mind?

Misato: I am not able to answer that question.
        Do Angels have the concept of mind?
        Do they understand human thoughts?
        Those are absolutely unknown.

D:      This incident shows the new point that the Angel tried to possess
        Eva.
        How about the possiblity of that point linking to the predictable 
        13th Angel.

Misato: Considering the patterns so far,
        the systematic coupling among the Angels is negative.

B:      That's right.
        It is obvious that their action has been independent, so far.

Misato: What does that mean?

Kihl:   You are not permitted to question.

Misato: Understood.

Kihl:   That's it. Lieve.

Misato: Yes.

- -
Kihl:   What do you think, Ikari-kun?

Gendou: Angels are getting more and more intelligent.
        The time left is

Kihl:   very short. You mean so?

        Episode 17
        The fourth
        Qualified Person 

- --
NurseA: The patient in the twelfth room?

NurseB: You mean that first aid in the Incident E?
        It's long since been hospitalized here.

NurseC: Quite difficult case is that injury.

NurseB: She's still a primary student.

NurseA: Has come today, that boy?

NurseC: Yeah.
        He never misses coming twice a week.
        A very good brother thinking much of his sister.

NurseB: That's right!
        Nowadays, that kinda boys are not many.

- --
Gendou: Rei, you are alright today?

Rei:    Yes.
        Tomorrow, I will be at Dr. Akagi's.
        The day after tomorrow, to school.

Gendou: How is your school life?

Rei:    I have no problem.

Gendou: I see. Then OK.
- --
Hikari: Stand up. Bow. sit down.

Teacher:Oh, absent are Ayanami and Aida, as usual?

Shinji: Kensuke, how come?

Teacher:And, today, Teacher Koike is absent.
        Therefore, the class of Modern Japanese is selfstudy.
        Today's person on duty is,

Touji:  New Yokosuka.
        Following battleships today as usual.
        I hear that something like "Myoukou" is in the port.

Teacher:Suzuhara!

Touji:  Ah, Ye, Yes! 

Teacher:Take the materials to Ayanami's later.

Touji:  Yes.
- --
Makoto: Anyhow, the status of the first branch is OK?
        No need! the data from the reconnaissance plane will be
        confirmed by Magi.

Shigeru:...

- --
Kouzou: Vanished?
        Did the second branch truly vanish?

Shigeru:Yes. Everything confirmed.
        It vanished.    
- --
Misato: Now I'm done for!

Makoto: The administration department and the inspection department above
        are uproarious. 
        The general affaire department is in panic.

Misato: And, the cause is?

Ritsuko:still under investigation.
        Only one clue is this image from a stationary satelite.
        Nothing else remains.

Maya:   Ten minits, Eighto, Seben, Shix, Fibe, Sree, Tsoo, Wan, Contacto.
# This must be "Ten seconds" but Maya clearly says "Ten Minits"
- -
Misato: Terrible!

Maya:   Evangelion Unit Four, together with
        all the installations concerned inside the range 89km 
        from the centre were perfectly vanished.

Ritsuko:Including thousands of people.

Shigeru:Presuming from the time-schedule, it should have been 
        the accident during the expreriment of installing
        S2 engine.

Maya:   The possible cause is, from insufficient quality of material
        to the mistake in the initial stage of the design.
        The total number of combination is 32,768.

Misato: There's a chance of sabotage.

Makoto: But, it was not an explosion, but a vanishment.

Ritsuko: Probably, swallowed by Direc's sea, just like Unit One
        at that time.

Misato: Then, also the S2 engine repared,,

Ritsuko: Vanished.
        And our dream also vanished.

Misato: It's because they forced to use something not quite understood.

Ritsuko: Eva is also such a thing.

- --
Misato: Then, how is the Unit three left going?

Ritsuko:We are about to accept that.
        U.S. administration does not seem to loose the first branch.

Misato: As for the Unit three and four, they insisted the right
        of the construction, and forced to build them.
        But, now, they force us to accept that.
        They push their luck.

Ritsuko:After that tragedy, anyone looses courage.

Misato: Then, how to do the booting test?
        using Rei's dummy?

Ritsuko:I will decide.
- --
Ritsuko:This is the prototype dummy plug.
        Rei's personality was transfered,
        though, the human mind, spirit is not digitalizable.
        This is nothing but a fake, something quasi,
        which imitates the pilot's thinking. Nothing but a machine.

Gendou: This transmits a signal pattern to Eva.
        Eva considers that a pilot is in it and syncronizes with this.
        That's what we need.
        Install the data to Unit One, and Two.

Ritsuko:This still has some problems.

Gendou: Don't care.
        If Eva moves, it will be OK.

Ritsuko: Understood.

- --
Gendou: The transportation of the Unit is being left entirely to UN.
        That will arrive this weekend.
        Then you will do things.

Ritsuko:Yes.
        The adjustment and the booting test will be done at Matsushiro.

Gendou: Test pilot is?

Ritsuko:Dummy plug is still dangerous.
        One out of the present candidates will be...

Gendou: appointed to the fourth.

Ritsuko:Yes.
        There's one child whose core will be ready immedeately.

Gendou: Entirely left to you.

Ritsuko:Yes.

Gendou: Rei, it's over.

Rei:    Yes.

Gendou: Let's have a meal.

Rei:    Yes.

- --
Hikari: Stand up. Bow.

Students: Phew!

Touji:  WOW, it's time for meal.
        It's the biggest pleasure in school life.

Asuka:  Oh, You did not bring our lanch boxes?

Shinji: La, Last night, I was busy at homework, so no time to cook.

Asuka:  Because of that, you say I must stay without lunch!

Touji:  Oh, the quallel between wife and husband?

Students: (Laugh)

Shinji&Asuka:   NO WAY!

- --
Misato: What? you seem serious.

Ritsuko:In the booting test of the Unit three at Matsushiro,
        we will use the fourth as the pilot.

Misato: The Fourth?
        The fourth children was found?

Ritsuko: Yesterday.

Misato: I haven't yet received the report from Malduk Institute.

Ritsuko:The official documents will arrive tomorrow.

Misato: Well, Dr. Akagi, don't you have something secret to me, again?

Ritsuko:No, nothing.

Misato: Well, OK.
        And, who is the selected child?

Misato: Wow, Is that no one but this child?

Ritsuko:We had no choice.
        The candidates were collected in one place
        and are being protected.

Misato: It's hard to tell this.
        Asuka is OK. She is proud of pilotting Eva.
        Rei is exceptional.
        Nothing good if concerned with Eva things and our matters.
        It is Shinji that knows these matters best.
        I don't want him to be more painful.

Ritsuko: However, we need those childrens of that kind,
        in order for all of us to survive.

Misato: You say to me, "don't avoid complications!"

- --
Students: Ciao!

Hikari: Suzuhara, you are on duty from today. Do your duty.

Touji:  What are you talking about?

Hikari: Materials! "Take these." said the teacher.

Touji:  What's that? Class Rep. There must be another one on duty.

Hikari: Ayanami-san is absent today.

Touji:  Ayanami and me?
        Then, it's no other choice.
        But, I no can go to a woman's flat alone.

Hikari: Then I will be together with you.

Touji:  Shinji, go home together with me, I hope!

Hikari: Ah,

Hikari: (sigh)

- --
Shinji: Ayanami, let me in.

Touji:  No good to enter into a woman's flat without permission.

Shinji: No other choice.
        She won't read if we put them into this.
- -
Shinji: Let me in.

Touji:  Oh, is this a woman's room?
        Nothing charming.

Touji:  Oh, no, don't touch, or She will get angry.

Touji:  I am only settling.

Touji:  I don't help you.
        It's not a man's business.

Shinji: OK, but Misato-san dislikes such a guy.

Touji:  hmmmm, No, I don't mind.
        'Cose It's my policy.
- -
Touji:  Changed a lot.

Shinji: What?

Touji:  You, Shinji.

Shinji: hmm?

Touji:  When I saw you first, I truly thought you a disgusting guy.
        You ain't seem like a guy who does something for the sake of 
        other people.
        Anyhow, It's sort of you are reserved.

Shinji: Ah?

Touji:  We are disturbing you.

Rei:    What?

Touji:  Those are the piled materials.

Shinji: Sorry, I settled on my own accord.
        I touched nothing but rubbish.

Rei:    Th..Thank you.

- --
Touji:  Well, It's true that Eva pilots are all strange guys.

- --
Rei:    "Thank you" the word for gratitude, the word for the first time,
        even though I've never said to that person.

Kouzou: Town, is a paradise that humans made.

Gendou: Driven out from the paradise,
        Fleeing to the world on the earth nearby death were human beings.
        Made by those weakest living things, made by the sapience 
        aquired because of that weakness, was a paradise of our own.

Kouzou: To protect from the fear of death,
        to satisfy ourselves with joy,
        made is a paradise...
        This town is indeed one.
        Equipped with weapons to protect ourselves, is this town.

Gendou: The town for those cawardly people fleeing from 
        the world outside with full of enemies.

Kouzou: Cawardly people live longer. That's one thing good.
        The Third New Tokyo City, NERV's camouflaged intercept
        fortress city.
        The Long-delayed seventh construction will be over.
        At last it will be complete.

Kouzou: How are you going to report to the committee on the accident
        of Unit four.

Gendou: The same as the fact, the cause is unknown.

Kouzou: Anyhow, it was a big damage, this time.

Gendou: I don't care about the unit four and the second branch.
        We lost the sample of S2 engine, while have data remaining in
        Germany. Unit one and this installation are enough.

Kouzou: But the committee is in panic.

Gendou: Natural because it's an unscheduled accident.

Kouzou: Seele must be busy at revising the schedule-table.

Gendou: Incidents missed in The Dead Sea Scroll may happen.
        That will teach the old men a lesson.

- --
Announce: The transformation of the third Area and the prototype weapon
        test will be done as scheduled.
        Dr. Nishizawa at Third engineering Section, Dr. Nishizawa,
        Connect to the Second development section immedeately.

Ryouji: Although the intercept system here will be finally complete,
        no celebration party is scheduled.
        NERV is a very strict system.

Maya:   Because Commander Ikari is such a man.

Ryouji: How about you?

Maya:   Are you OK with this, Kaji-san?
        I will tell this to Katsuragi-san and Senior Akagi.
        
Ryouji: Before you say, I cover your mouth.

Misato: Your business is going on?

Ryouji: Oh, well, normally.

Maya:   I have a job to do. Excuse me.
- -
Misato: Although I don't say anything about your private life,
        I beg you not to seduce young girls here in this emergent
        situation.

Ryouji: It is not your business to administrate it.
        And, is it OK, if it is you, Katsuragi.

Misato: It depends on your answer you are about to say.
        You must know the secrets of Malduk Institute and ADAM 
        underground.

Ryouji: What?

Misato: No use pretending to be ignorant.

Ryouji: It's not like your way to ask help from someone.

Misato: I don't care a bit what people say about me.
        I am not reserved at the moment.
        Timely the fourth children was found.
        What is the hidden reason for that?

Ryouji: I tell you one thing.

Ryouji: Malduk Institute does not exist.
        It's nothing but NERV that is pulling the strings.

Misato: Nothing but NERV?
        Commander Ikari?

Ryouji: Code Seven O Seven. Investigate it.

Misato: Seven O Seven?
        Shinji-kun's school?

Shinji: Misato-san.

Misato: What?

Shinji: Ritsuko-san expects you at the meeting for tomorrow's business trip.

Misato: Alright, thanx.

Misato: See you next.

Ryouji: hmm.

Ryouji: How about having a cup of tea with me.

Shinji: Me,  male.

- --
Shinji: I thought Kaji-san be more serious.

Ryouji: You dare say such a word to someone reliable, Shinji-kun.

Shinji: Oh, sorry.

Ryouji: Oh, I am sorry too.
        I don't mean to say something unpleasant.
        Oh, I show you one thing good.

- --
Shinji: Water melon is this?

Ryouji: Don't you think it's cute?
        This is my hobby.
        Keep this secret to others.
        Making something, or bring something up is nice!
        We see and learn many things through that.
        Also pleasure.

Shinji: Also something painful.

Ryouji: Do you dislike something painful?

Shinji: I don't like.

Ryouji: Did you find some pleasure.

Ryouji: That's nice.
        But, the one knowing many pains is more kind to others.
        That's different from weekness.

Ryouji: Hello, Hello, 

Ryouji: From Katsuragi. Syncro-test will be held soon.

- --
Maya:   Plug depth fixed to 3.2.
        LCL concentration ...
        Harmonics level is minus 1.2, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.9..
        The present reading is 0.2.
        Level3 Data deleted.
        Others are saved to Melchior.

Ritsuko:It is true.
        Shinji-kun's syncro ratio is getting worse.

Misato: What does that mean?

Ritsuko:I can say nothing.
        But, I guess something happened in the last accident,
        something mental.

Misato: It's even more difficult to tell about Unit three's pilot.

Ritsuko:But, the person onself will be officially notified tomorrow.

Misato: hmmm.

- --
Hikari: Stand up, Attention, Bow.

Touji:  Phew, Meal Meal!

Announce:Suzuhara Touji of second year A Class, Suzuhara Touji.
        You are expected to the Director's room immediately.

Touji:  What's that?

Kensuke: Did you do something?

Touji:  No, nothing I remember.

- --
Touji:  Suzuhara Touji is entering.

Ritsuko:You are Suzuhara Touji-kun.

- --
Shinji: How is your excursion to New-Yokosuka, yesterday.

Kensuke:Absolutely Nice!
        By the way, I obtained some information slightly worrying.

- -
Shinji: Eva Unit Three?

Kensuke:Right.
        The guy under construction in the states.
        Completed?

Shinji: No idea.

Kensuke: I know why you must keep secret, but
        please tell me.

Shinji: I've never heard of that.

Kensuke: Don't you know the rumour that the booting test will be
        held at Second experiment installation in Matsushiro?

Shinji: I don't know.

Kensuke: The pilot has not yet been appointed?

Shinji: I've no idea about that.

Kensuke: She could let me pilot that, Misato-san.
        Hey, Shinji, please ask that.
        I really wish to get on Eva.

Shinji: Really I don't know.

Kensuke: Then the story that Unit Four was lost?

Shinji: What is that?

Kensuke:Don't you really know that?
        The second branch was blown down.
        My daddy's section was in panic.

Shinji: Really?

Kensuke: Presumably.

Shinji: I've never heard anything from Misato-san.

Kensuke:Hmmm,
        The pilot at the end of system has nothing to do with that.
        If she does not tell you, you need not to know that.
        Sorry for my asking strange questions.
        hmm, Anyhow, Touji guy has not yet been back.

- --
Teacher: We, human beings survived the hell called the Second Impact,
        and stood up after that.
        Currently, the children are decreasing, year by year.

Hikari: Oh,,

Touji:  Sorry for late.

Teacher:I've heard of the story. Sit down on the seat.
        Well, those young generations who are torchbearers of
        the future are...

- --
Kensuke:Hey, let's go home.

Shinji: Touji is?

Kensuke: He will be late,
        'cose on duty.
- --
Announce:It's time to go home.
        Those students remaining in class rooms are strongly suggested
        to go home immedeately.
# Oh, Almost the same phrase appeared in GunBuster Episode 1.

Hikari: Suzuhara.

Touji:  Ah?

Hikari: You are on duty.
        You must align desks, and write the dayly record.

Touji:  Me, not yet had lunch.
        When finish, I will do.

Hikari: Suzuhara's lunch is always the lunch box at the school shop.

Touji:  It's nobody that cooks for me.

Hikari: Suzuhara,,, -kun.

Touji:  hm?

Hikari: I have two sisters, One is Kodama, the other is Nozomi.
        I always cook lunch boxes for them.

Touji:  It's a toil for you.

Hikari: So, I am quite good at cooking, though you might not imagin so.

Touji:  hmm.

Hikari: So, I always waste the materials for lunch box.

Touji:  You are wasting.

Hikari: Oh!

Touji:  For the leftover disposal, I will help you at any amount.

Hikari: Oh, Yeah,
        Please help me.

Ritsuko: So, Shinji don't know about it yet?

Misato: I just can't find a chance to say that.  I'm afraid since I can't 
        figure out what he is thinking about.

Ritsuko: Come on, you are the one who wanted to be his gurdian.

Misato: Yea, I know...  So, when the pilot will be called?

Ritsuko: It's gonna be tommorow since there are some preparations to be made.

Misato: He may tell about it by himself.

Ritsuko: That's impossible.  He was not happy enough to brag around.  
        The condition he made was to transfer his little sister to the
        head quater's medical unit.

------------------
Kensuke: Misato is cold, really.  Since I am most willing, why don't they use
        me even as back up.

Touji: Huh?  Oh yea.

Shinji: What's wrong.  You left home much earlier than me but you are pretty 
        late.

Touji: Oh, no marital quarrel today?

Asuka: I just didn't want to see your faces!  You Three Stooges!

------------------
Kensuke: Now for the lunch.  Huh?  Where is Touji?

Shinji: I can't see him anywhere.

Kensuke: Gone? Without eating lunch?  That's impossible.

Shinji: Yes, he is acting weird recently.

------------------
Rei: Suzuhara-kun,

Touji: Huh? Oh, it's you, Ayanami.  If you are looking for Shinji, he
        isn't here.
        You know about me.  Souryu seems to know about it, too.

Rei:    Yes.

Touji:  Shinji is the only one who doesn't know.
        It is really rare of you to warry about the others.

Rei:    Really?  I really can't understand.

Touji:  You are warried about Shinji.

Rei:    Really?  May be that's true.

Touji:  Yap.

------------------
Asuka:  Hikari! Let's eat lunch.

------------------
Misato: Late for two hours, and at last, he is here.
        He is the first guy to make me wait this long.

Ritsuko:When you were dating, you just left without waiting, right?

------------------
Teacher: Therefore, it was the incident generally known as the Second Impact.
        I was living at Nebukawa at the time, but now, it is under the sea 
        because Antarctic's ice was melted and sea level has risen.

------------------
Touji: I'm sorry, new kid.  I have to hit you.  I have to hit you for the
        sake of my satisfaciton.

------------------
Hikari: I'm sorry, Asuka.  You are always with Ikari on the way home.

Asuka:  Don't warry, I'm with Shinji as duty, and I'm not in the mood to see 
        his face, too.
        About Suzuhara, right?

Hikari: Yes. Can you tell?

Asuka:  It's so easy to see that.  Only those Three Stooges cannot see.

Hikari: But Ikari-kun seems naive.

Asuka:  That one is the dullest.  Also an idiot.  He does not know how to go
        around with the others.

Hikari: Really.
        Ayanami-san can be the girl Suzuhara likes.

Asuka: Suzuhara likes that teacher's pet?

Hikari: They were getting along well at lunch time.

Asuka:  That girl knows how to get along with people ten thousandth as
        well as Shinji.

Hikari: Really?

Asuka:  Really!
        May I ask a question?

Hikari: What?

Asuka:  Why do you like that hot headed idiot?

Hikari: He is kind.

Asuka:  What?

------------------
Woman(On TV):   Oh, making up with you then was the mistake!

Man(On TV):     Don't tell me that now...

Shinji: Well...

Asuka: Mr.Kaji takes long time to bath.

Shinji: Who will pilot the Unit 3?

Asuka: What?  You haven't heard about it yet?

Shinji: Who?

Asuka: I don't know.

Ryouji: That was a good hot bath.  Huh?  Bickering again?  Can't belive it.
        Are you two are like this whenever Katsuragi is gone?

Asuka:  No!  I want to smile pretty since you are staying with me for tonight.
        But not today.  I cannot smile!

Ryouji: I understand.  Let's sleep.  Hitting the bed is the best solution
        in the situation like this.

------------------
Shinji: Are you asleep already, Mr.Kaji?

Ryouji: No, not yet.

Shinji: What kind of person my father is?

Ryouji: Well, I'm surprised with that question.  I thought you are going to
        talk about Katsuragi.

Shinji: It seems you are always with him.

Ryouji: The dupty commander is the one with him all the time.  Are you asking
        around about your father?

Shinji: I wasn't with him for a long time...

Ryouji: So,you don't know.

Shinji: But I understood many things about my father recently.  About his
        job, about my mother. So,...

Ryouji: That is wrong.  You just feel like you understood.  Well, that is why
        people try to know each other.  That's why the life is interesting.

Shinji: Is that fit with your relationships with Misato, too?

Ryouji:  Kanojo(she, girlfriend in Japanese) in Kanji means a woman far way.
        For us, women existing on the shore across.  It means there is a river
        wider and deeper than ocean between men and women.

Shinji: I cannot understand the grown-ups.

        be under your direct command.

Misato: Exclusive possession of four EVAs...  If we want, we can ends this 
        world.

Ritsuko: Did you talk to Shinji?

Misato: After this test.

Female Operater: Fourth Children has arrived.  Squad 2, begin entry 
        prepartations immediately.

------------------
Hikari: He hasn't come yet, Asuke.

Asuka:  He may not come today.

Hikari: I thought he would eat today.  Do you want eat this?

------------------
Kensuke:Unit 3 should be in Japan already, right?

Shinji: Yes. I think it arrived yesterday.

Kensuke:I'm so jealous.  Who's gonna ride it?  Touji, maybe? He is absent
        today.

Shinji: No way.

Ritsuko: Can it be an angel?

EPISODE:18
AMBIVALENCE
------------------
Shigeru: An explosion accident at Matsushiro.

Male Operater: Air transportation is planned to start on 20.

------------------
Shinji: An accident at Matsushiro?  No...  How about Misato?

Rei:    Cannot get contact yet.

Shinji: Oh, no. What should I do?

Asuka:  What are you whining about?  We cannot do anything but warrying now.

Shinji: But we have to go against the Angel by our own...

Rei:    Commander Ikari is taking direct command for now.

Shinji: My father is...?

------------------
Shigeru: We get the visual at Nobeyama.  Visual to the main screen.

All:    Wow.

Fuyutsuki:Just as we thought.

Gendou: Transmit the terminal signal.  Excute the forced ejection of the 
        entry plug.

Maya:   Impossible.  It doesn't recognize the both teminal signal and plug 
        ejection code.

Gendou: How about the pilot.

Makoto: We have his respiration and pulse, however...

Gendou: From this moment, Evangelion Unit 3 is abandoned, and the target is 
        recognized as the 13th angel.

Makoto: B, But, sir.

Gendou: Develope the front at Nobeyama as planned, and destroy the target.

------------------
Shigeru:The target is approaching.

Makoto: All unit, stand by for the ground battle.

Shinji: What? No way. An Angel?  You mean that is an Angel?

Gendou: Yes. That is the target.

Shinji: The target?  That is EVA.

Asuka:  Can't believe it.  Taken over by a angel?

Shinji: Does it pilotted by a kid, just like the other units?  The kid of same
        age?

Asuka:  Don't you know yet?  On the Unit 3,

Shinji: Asuka?

Asuka:  Yeeeeee!

Shinji: Asuka!
------------------
Makoto: Eva Unit 3 was silenced completely.

Maya:   Pilot have ejected. Salvage crew is on the way.

Shigeru:The target is moving toward Unit Zero.

Gendou: Rei, avoid close combat, and stop the target.  I'll send Unit 1 soon.

Rei:    Roger.
------------------
Rei:    He is inside.
        Ack!
        Ulk, ugrrrrr.
    
Maya:   The Angel invading the left arm, Unit Zero.  The nerve joint is being
        invaded.

Gendou: Cut off the left arm, now.

Maya:   But we must cut off the nerve connection.

Gendou: Cut off the left arm.

Maya:   Yes, sir.

Rei:    Yeeeeeee!

Maya:   Middle class damage to the Unit Zero, and the pilot have been injured.

Shinji: No...

Gendou: The target is approaching.  You will contact within 20. You take
        care of it.

Shiji:  You say it is the target, 
        but aren't there a person in there?
        A kid of the same age.
        An entry plug.  There Is a person inside of it.
        Grrrrrrr.

Makoto: Trouble in life support.

Maya:   The pilot is in danger.

Fuyutsuki: Oh no.  Cut the synchronization to 60%.

Gendou:Wait.

Fuyutsuki: But if you maintain the status, the pilot will die.

Gendou: Shiji, why don't you fight?

Shinji: But there is a person inside, father.

Gendou: It doesn't matter.  It is an Angel.  Our Enermy.

Shinji: But I cannot do that.  I have to save the one.  I cannot kill a person.

Gendou: You will die.

Shinji: I don't care.  It's much better than killing someone.

Gendou: Go ahead and cut the synchronization of the pilot and the Unit 1 
        completely.

Maya:   Cutting off, sir?

Gendou: Yes. Switch the circuit to the dummy plug.

Maya:   But sir, the dummy system still has many problems, and without 
        Akagi's direction...

Gendou: It works better than the pilot.  Do it.

Maya:   Yes, sir.

Shiji:  What?  What did you do father!

Makoto: The signal reception comfirmed.

Maya:   Control system was switched.

Male    Operater: All nerves are now connected to the dummy system.

Female  Operater: 32.8% of the emotional facter is unclear.  Unable to monitor.

Gendou: It doesn't matter.  Release the system.  Commence the attack.

All:    Wow.

Maya:   Is this the power of the dummy plug?

Female Operater: All systems are normal.

Male Operater: More increase in gain.

Maya:   Owwww.

Shinji: No! Father, no!  Please stop doing this!       

        Damn! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

        Owwwww! No!  NOOOO!

Shigeru: E, Eva Unit 13, No, the target was completely silenced.
------------------
Hikari: Teeedaaada(Humming)
        This looks good.  Kodama, Nozomi, and me.  Lunch for four.  Will he
        eat tommorow?
------------------
Rescuer male: Over here!  A suviver!  BQR, get the medics in hurry!

Male:   Yes, that recorder's graphs... (Unable to hear) Get rid of it.

Misato: Alive...
        Kaji....?

Ryouji: You were lucky, Katsuragi.

Misato: How about Ritsuko?

Ryouji: Don't warry.

        Her condition is better than yours.

Misato: Ah-ha.  How about EVA Unit 3?

Ryouji: It was taken care as an Angel by the Unit 1.

Misato: I, I haven't tell anything to Shiji.
------------------
Misato: Shinji...

Shinji: Misato, you were OK.

Misato: I, I'm sorry.  I had to tell you an important thing, but... 

Shinji: Misato, I've...I've... My father...  I begged him not to...

Misato: Shinji, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Maya:   A report from the entry plug salvage crew.  Comfirmed the survival of
        the pilot.

Shinji: Still alive.

Male 1: Roger.  Cut the deformed part with lazer.

Male 2: Send changed LCL sample to (unable to hear) as priority.

Evangelion Episode 19

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Avant Title

Maya:     The interlocking circuit has been cut.

Kouzou:   How about the ejection signal?

Maya:     It's locked from the plug side.
          Doesn't get received.

Makoto:   But Shinji-kun, if we hadn't done that,
          you'd have been done for!
          
Shinji:   That's not my concern.

Makoto:   But that also is a fact.

Shinji:   Don't make me more angry by saying such things!
          185 seconds are left to Unit One.
                  This is enough for destroying at least half of the Headquarters.

Shigeru:  He, in his current condition, would do it.

Maya:     Shinji-kun, listen to us.
          Without Commander Ikari's judgment,
          everyone could have been killed.

Shinji:   I'm saying that's not my concern!
          My father ... that man was going to kill Touji,
          by these hands of mine.

         Episode: 19

         Battle of a Man

-------------------------------------------------------
Shinji:   Father, you are there, aren't you?
          Say something; answer me!

Gendou:   Raise the LCL pressure to the limit.

Maya:     Huh!?

Gendou:   There is no time to spare for an impossible child.
-
Shinji:   I still have a direct connect....
          ug, ghuahah, ahg,
          darn, darn, d, darn...
--
Male voice 1: The dissolving process of the right breast has been completed.

Female voice: We'll start the cleansing of the body fluids from
              three-O on schedule.

Male voice 2: The sixth part is going to be processed by heat.
              The operators in the area, evacuate now.

Ritsuko:  Are you OK already?

Misato:   There is no problem in so far as I can work.
          I just can't be off in this state of emergency.
          What happened to Shinji-kun?

Ritsuko:  I heard that they cut the emergency hatch open 
          with a laser cutter, and he has been removed by force.

Misato:   I got really told on by this case...

--
Asuka:    It may be all up with him.
          That idiot won't get by, I guess.

Rei:      How's Ikari-kun?

Asuka:    He hasn't been injured, so he'll come around soon.
          He'd be dreaming now.

Rei:      Dream?

Asuka:    Yeah, haven't you dreamt?

--
Touji:    Shinji,
          why is Shinji lying on the bed by me?
          I wonder where I am.
          Is it my sister's hospital?

-- Touji's "dream" --

Touji:    Oh my, aren't they Shinji and Ayanami?

Rei:      Shinji-kun, why did you do that?

Shinji:   I couldn't forgive my father, who betrayed me.
          Though finally I could have a nice talk with him,
          My father doesn't understand my feeling at all.

Rei:      Did you try to understand ... your father's feeling?

Shinji:   I did.

Rei:      Why don't you try?

Shinji:   I said "I did"!

Rei:      You run away from disagreeable things like that.

Shinji:   Isn't it all right?
          What's wrong with running away from disagreeable things?

Touji:    What are they arguing, those two...?

-- back to the reality --

Nurse:    You have a special permission to visit him only for
          five minutes.

Hikari:   Yes ma'am, thank you very much.

-
Touji:    Oh my, the Class Rep., ain't you?

Hikari:   Suzuhara, are you OK?

Touji:    Looks like I'm alive.
          Somehow I felt Shinji was here, but I wonder if it was a dream.

Hikari:   I heard Ikari-kun had left the hospital yesterday.
          You were sleeping for three days, Suzuhara.

Touji:    Was I?  So long as three days?
          Class Rep, you ...

Hikari:   Ugh, I came here as the Class Rep, by the official duty.
          It's nothing but that.

Touji:    Ah, I know.

Hikari:   (No, you don't.)

Touji:    I apologize...  that I couldn't eat the lunch.

Hikari:   Never mind ... such a matter.
          But I'm sorry.
          They say I can't let you eat a lunch here.

Touji:    Class Rep.

Hikari:   What?

Touji:    Can I ask you one favor?

Hikari:   Uh huh.

Touji:    Why don't you tell my sister that I've got nothing serious?

Hikari:   Uh huh.

--
NERV worker: Get out, Mr. Shinji Ikari.
             General Commander will be seeing you.
-
Gendou:   Disobeying orders.  Private occupation of EVA.
          Crude intimidation.  These are all criminal acts.
          Do you have anything you want to claim?

Shinji:   Yes, I don't want to pilot EVA any more.
          I don't want to stay here either.

Gendou:   Well then, get out.

Shinji:   I will.  I'll return where the Teacher is.

Gendou:   Do you run again?
          You disappointed me.
          I assume we won't see again.

Shinji:   I intend we won't.

--
Gendou:   It's me.
          The Third Child-REN is to be obliterated.
          Set Rei as the basis for the Unit One pilot and
          the dummy plug as backup.

--
Kensuke:  Are you Shinji listening?
          Is it true that you are going out of here?
          It's true, isn't it?
          But why?
          Why you run now?
          I've been admiring you.
          I envied you.  You are different from us.
          Darn, while even Touji can pilot EVA, I...

Female voice: This line has been monitored.
              For the security reasons, we have terminated the call.
              Thank you for your cooperation.
--
Shinji:   I assume Asuka won't come, being speechless.

Misato:   No, she even didn't say 'hi' to you.

Shinji:   It's becoming to her.
          I'm relieved.

Misato:   It'll be hard to keep saying those pretty things.

Shinji:   That's your way of life, Misato-san.
          I can't follow that.

Misato:   I think you know, but there will be a fair amount of restrictions
          on your behavior.

Shinji:   I know.  Um....

Misato:   What?

Shinji:   Tell me just one thing;
          Why it's Touji...  the Fourth Child-REN...?

Misato:   The fourth level candidates are all your class mates.
          I learned that recently too.
          It was all contrived.

Shinji:   Everyone, everyone in the class...

Misato:   As for Suzuhara-kun's matter,
          it's not a mistake recovered by apologizing with any words.
          But Shinji-kun, to be honest, I was projecting my dream,
          hope and purpose upon you.
          I know it's been a load to you.
          But we, everyone at NERV, had no choice but to trust our 
          future to you.
          Just remember that, please.

Shinji:   It's a selfish cause, isn't it?

Misato:   I know that.
          I'll leave your pass-code up to the headquarters and your room
          as they are.

Shinji:   It's no use.
          Please do away with them.
          I won't pilot EVA any more.

Misato:   (He's speaking positively [in his own words].
           It's the first time to hear something like this.)
--
Announce: Right now, the emergency was announced around the Tokai region.
          The residents should evacuate to the designated shelter as soon 
          as possible.  To repeat.  Right now, ....

INTROJECTION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator: To all, the battle alert of the first kind.
          Prepare for the surface-to-air countering.

Kouzou:   The target status?

Shigeru:  Currently invading.
-
          The Komagatake defense line, broken through.
-
Operator: From First to Eighteenth Armors, damaged.

Makoto:   It's got special armors as many as eighteen in an instant!

Misato:   We can't make it for the ground level countering by EVA.

Misato:   Post Unit Two in the Geofront,
          on the rim of the Headquarters facilities.
-
          Let Asuka snipe the target at the instant it invades into the
Geofront!
-
          The Unit Zero status?

Maya:     It's been posted at the AT field neutral zone.

Ritsuko:  The left arm hasn't been regenerated.

Misato:   Then, can't be engaged...

Gendou:   Put Rei out on Unit One.

Misato:   Hmm?

Gendou:   Prepare a dummy plug as backup.

Misato:   Yes sir.
--
????:     Start the entry.

Maya:     LCL injected.

Ritsuko:  Start the A10 nerve connection.

Rei:      Ug!
          (It doesn't make it, any more.)
-
Operator: Pulses reverse.

Maya:     Unit One is refusing the nerve connection.

Ritsuko:  I cannot believe that.

Kouzou:   Ikari...

Gendou:   Yes, it's refusing me.

-
Gendou:   Stop the start-up.
-
          Let Rei make a sortie on Unit Zero.
          Restart Unit One by the dummy plug.

Misato:   But Unit Zero is....

Rei:      I don't mind.  I go.

Misato:   Rei!?
-
Rei:      Even if I die, there is a substitute.
--
Shinji:    (I decided not to pilot any more...)

A Man:     Hey you, what are you doing?
           Evacuate to the shelter quickly.
--
Shigeru:  It's no good.
          One more hit will break through all the armors.

Misato:   I trust on you, Asuka.
--
Asuka:    Here it comes.
          Even though someone like Shinji is absent,
          that's just a cinch for me alone.

Asuka:    This damn ....!

Asuka:    Shit, Next!

Asuka:    The AT field must have been neutralized.
          Why it doesn't get done for?

Asuka:    Here I am, who can't lose any more!

Asuka:    Huh?  No kidding!

Asuka:    Kugh, huhg...
-
          This damn SOB!
-
Misato:   Asuka!
          Cut all the nerve connection.  Fast!
-
Asuka:    Huh!?.

-- flashback --
Asuka: Evacuation exercise?
        Are you idiot?
        That's nothing to do with us pilots.
-- 

Shinji:   Huhhgh!

Announce: Direct hit to the eighth sector.

Shinji:   Huuhh.

Announce: Abandon the sixth shelter.
          Survivors, rush to the third shelter!

         --
Shigeru:  Unit Two wrecked.  Not able to combat.

Misato:   How's Asuka?
-
Makoto:   She's safe ... alive!

Asuka:    Kwuh, hh,..hhg, .... SOB...
-
Shigeru:  The Angel starts moving.
-
Misato:   The Unit One status?
-
Female operator:  Dummy plug loading completed.

Female operator:  The probe insertion completed.
-
Ritsuko:  Start the contact.

Maya:     Roger.

Ritsuko:  What is it?

Maya:     Pulses disappear.
          It refuses the dummy.
          It failed.  EVA Unit One doesn't start up.  

Ritsuko:  The dummy, Rei...

Kouzou:   .. is refused.

Gendou:   Fuyuzuki, I leave you here for a while.

--
A Man:    The injured are to the sixth block.

A Man:    Let the non-injured hurry to the third center! 

--
A Man:    This way!
A Man:    Fast!
A Man:    Hurry up!
A Man:    Fast!
A Man:    Hey you!  What are you doing?  Do you want to die?
-
Shinji:   Asuka...
-
Ryouji:   Isn't it Shinji-kun?
Shinji:   Kaji-san.
          What are you doing in the place like this?

Ryouji:   Those are my lines.  What are you doing, Shinji-kun? 

Shinji:   I, I won't pilot EVA any more.  Since I decided so...

Ryouji:   Uh-huh?
          As my part-time job has gone public,
          I lost a position in the battle shift.
          Since then, I'm watering here.

Shinji:   In such a time?

Ryouji:   It's because of such a time.
          Though I like to be in Katusragi's breasts,
          I'd like to be here when I die.

Shinji:   Die?

Ryouji:   Right.
          They say that when an Angel comes into contact with Adam,
          which is sleeping underground here, all humans will be
          terminated, which will be the Third Impact.
          It can be stopped only by Evangelion, which is as powerful as
          Angels.

Shinji:   Ayanami!  Even without a rifle!
-
Rei:      Kuhg!
-
Ritsuko:  Wants blow herself away?

Gendou:   Rei!
-
Rei:      AT field, full power!
-
Shinji:   Ugh, guhh.
-
Makoto:   Huh, Unit Zero!
-
Misato:   Rei!
-
Ritsuko:  What did she dare....?
-
Shinji:   Hh, Huhh...

Ryouji:   Shinji-kun, I can do nothing but water here.
          But for you, I bet there is the thing which YOU can do and
          only you can do.
          Nobody forces you.
          Think by yourself and decide by yourself ...
          what you should do now.
          Well, I wish you no regret.

-
Male operator: Direct hit to the third basement.

Makoto:   Final armor plate fused.

Misato:   It's no good.  The main shaft is exposed.

Ritsuko:  Isn't Unit One ready yet?

Male operator: Dummy plug refused.
-
Male operator: It failed.  No response.

Gendou:   Carry on.  Once more, do it again from one-O-eight.

Shinji:   Let me pilot!
          Let me, me, pilot this, Unit One!
          Father...

Gendou:   Why are you here?

Shinji:   Ngh, I, I am the pilot of Evangelion Unit One, Ikari Shinji!
--
Shigeru:  The target intruded into the main shaft!
          It's descending.

Misato:   What is its destination?

Makoto:   Directly advancing to the Central Dogma.

Misato:   It's coming here.
          All personnel to be evacuated.  Fast!

Makoto:   All personnel to be evacuated.
          To repeat; all personnel to be evacuated.

-
Misato:   Sh**t. (sp?)
Ugh!
Misato:   EVA Unit One!  Shinji-kun.

Shinji:   Misato-san!

Misato:   No. 5, launch it immediately!

Shinji:   The power run out!
-
Maya:     It's the Unit One operation limit.
          The backup doesn't work either.

Misato:   Shinji-kun.
-
Misato:   Shinji-kun!
-
Shinji:   Move, move, move.  Move, please move.
          There is no use if it doesn't move now!
Ahg!
-
Misato:   That is ...?
-
Shinji:   Move, move, move,
          move, move, move, move, move, move, move,
          move, move, please move!
          If it doesn't move now, if I don't do it now,
          everyone's going to die!
          I can't stand such a thing any more.
          So, please move!
-
Maya:     E, Eva restarted.
-
Misato:   Awesome....

Maya:     Impossible, I cannot believe it.
          The synchro-rate of Unit One is over 400 %.

Ritsuko:  It means *she* has been awakened.
-
Misato:   It's devouring the Angel.
-
Ritsuko:  Is it that she's taking the S2 organ into herself?
-                                 an?
Maya:     Ugh!
-
Ritsuko:  The binding ...

Makoto:   Thebinding?

Ritsuko:  Yes, it's not an armor.
          It's the restrainer for us to control EVA's intrinsic power.
          The spell is now being dissolved by her own power.
          For us, it's impossible to stop EVA any more.
-
Ryouji:   The awakening and liberation of Unit One.
          Seele wouldn't overlook it.
-
          Is this also in your scenario, Commander Ikari?

Kouzou:   It's begun, hasn't it?

-
Gendou:   Yes, everything begins now.

OPENING THEME SONG 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 *Eva-01 roars.

---
Misato: It's eating the Angel. 

---
Ritsuko: The bindings are being released themselves. We can't stop
   Eva any more. 

---
Ryoji: Eva-01's awakening and releasing. Seele don't keep quiet when
   they know this. 

---
Committee A: S2 organ which can't be emerged in Eva series. 

Committee B: I didn't imagine that it can take it in. 

Committee C: It's an accident which is much different from the events
   of our Seele's scenario. 

Committee D: This can't be adjusted easily. 

Committee A: IKARI Gendo. I'm afraid that it was our fault to give
   him NERV. 

Kiel: But it was the only one who could do all plans. 

---
Kozo: It began. 

Gendo: Yes, everything has yet to come.

Episode 20 

Hito no Katachi

THE FIRST DAY 

---
Maya: Evas' damages are beyond Henflick limitation. 

Ritsuko: It may take a long time for everything to return to its
   former state. 

Maya: Fortunately, MAGI system can be transplanted. We can begin to
   work tomorrow, say. 

Ritsuko: But this place seems to be useless. 

Shigeru: Decision of discarding is a matter of time now. 

Ritsuko: Well. For the present, we can only use the reserve Control
   Center-02. 

Maya: Without MAGI? 

Ritsuko: Yes. We'll be at work this morning after brushing dust off. 

Maya: It's too cramped around the chairs and the sensors aren't
   operated smoothly. It's hard to operate here. 

Shigeru: The layout is the same as the familiar Control Center-01. 

Maya: I have a feeling of wrongness. 

Ritsuko: At present that's better than we can't use it. It's Unit One
   which has been proved to be used. 

---
Misato: It has been binded in the cage. Is it all right? 

Makoto: Neither heat, eletrons, electromagnetic wave nor other
   chemical energy are detected within it. S2 organ is completely
   suspended. 

Misato: Nevertheless, this Unit One moved three times. 

---
Misato: Only with the visible situations, we can't decide how we
   should do with it. 

Makoto: If we do something thoughtlessly, there is no saying what it
   may do. It's the same as Katsuragi-san. I'm sorry. 

---
Kiel: But it isn't only a question of Eva-01. 

Committee C: That's right. Serious damage to Unit Zero and Unit Two.
   Partially destroyed Headquarters. Exposure of Central Dogma. It
   was great damage. 

Committee A: I can't estimate how much money and time we lost. 

Comittee B: It was because a bell isn't attached to Ikari's neck. 

Comittee D: A bell is attached but it didn't ring. 

Kiel: The bell which doesn't ring has no meanings. We'll make it work
   next time. 

---
Ryoji: Oh dear! These developments were unxpected, weren't you? For
   Committee, well, Seele, how will you make an excuse? 

Kozo: Unit One wasn't under our control. This is an accident. 

Gendo: So Unit One is frozen. Until Committee's another order. 

Ryoji: That's a good dealing. Well, your son has been taken in it,
   you know. 

---
Maya: We're hopeless, after all. The signal for ejecting an entry
   plug isn't accepted. 

Ritsuko: How is the backup and the dummy signal? 

Maya: They are also rejected. Even the direct circuit is
   disconnected. 

Makoto: The video circuit is connected. I'll transfer it to the main
   monitor. 

All: Uhhhhh! 

Misato: What is it? 

Ritsuko: This is the true character of 400% synchronization. 

Misato: I can't believe it! What the hell is the matter with
   Shinji-kun? 

Ritsuko: He has been taken in Eva-01. 

Misato: What do you mean? What is Eva?! 

Ritsuko: The thing created by humans with a humanlike figure. I can't
   say it in other way. 

Misato: Created by humans? You only make a copy of what you pick up
   on Antarctica then. Original? I'm dumbfounded. 

Ritsuko: It isn't just a copy. A human will is in it. 

Misato: Do you mean that this was of someone's will? 

Ritsuko: Or Eva's. 

Misato: Do something! You made that, didn'd you? Take the
   consequences! 

---
THE SECOND DAY 

---
Radio: ... as for the problem of 

Rei: I'm still alive... 

---
Asuka: I know the woman is well! Misato, don't phone me for such a
   trivial thing! 

Asuka: I could nothing... I was outdone by that stupid Shinji... How
   vexing! 

---
THE THIRD DAY 

---
Misato: Shinji-kun salvaging project? 

Ritsuko: Yes. What to be called Shinji-kun's life still exists. 

Misato: Is life respected this time? 

Ritsukko: Losing Shinji-kun is out of the question now. 

Misato: I don't know. What Nerv want isn't his life but Unit One as
   their tool. 

Ritsuko: I don't deny it. 

Maya: Shinji-kun's body is supposed to be drifting in the entry plug
   in the quantum form because it lost its ego-border. 

Misato: You mean that Shinji has transformed into something which we
   can't identify visibly? 

Maya: Definitely. The LCL ingredients in the plug changed chemically
   are now very like the seawater of the primitive earth. 

Misato: Life soup... 

Ritsuko: All of the materials which formed Shinji-kun are kept in the
   plug. What should be called his soul exits there. In fact, his ego
   image gives pseudosubstance to his plugsuit. 

Maya: Salvaging means making his body reconstructed and his soul
   fixed in it. 

Misato: Is it possible? 

Ritsuko: With MAGI's supports. 

Misato: You're saying about the theory, aren't you? Nobody knows the
   results without doing. 

---
THE FOURTH DAY 

---
Shinji: What's this? Where am I? Entryplug of Unit One? Nobody is
   here. I'm not. What's this? What's this? What's this? I don't
   know. These people. Yes. The people who I know, the people who
   know me. I see. Everything is in my world. What's this? I don't
   know it although this is my world. An image from outside. An
   unpleasant image. I see. An enemy. ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY. Our
   enemies called Angel which have the angelic names. Evs's and
   Nerv's target. Revenge of Misato's father. Why am I fighting? I go
   so far as to have such a bitter experience. 

---
Asuka: You idiot! Unknown fellows come and attack against us, you
   know. It's natural that we have to deal with a lot of difficulties
   coming unexpectedly down on our heads. 

---
Shinji: I don't need the reason? I shouldn't think of it? ENEMY,
   ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY, EVERYONE IS ENEMY! Something threatening me,
   us. It means ENEMY. Definitely. Nobody think badly of me if I
   myself protect my life, our lives! ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY. My
   ENEMY! My ENEMY!! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! You injured Toji and
   killed Mother! Father. Uhhhhhh! 

---
Rei: Why do you hate your father? 

Shinji: Of course. A father like him. 

Rei: Can't you understand your father? 

Shinji: Of course because I have hardly ever met him. 

Rei: Is that the reason why you hate him? 

Shinji: Yes. Father don't need me. Father deserted me. 

Rei: Am I the substitute? 

Shinji: Definitely. It must be the truth! I was deserted because he
   had Ayanami. 

Chibi-Rei: As if you didn't run away of your own accord. 

Shinji: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Father is to be totally blamed!
   Then I was going to tell him that I hated him. 

---
Shinji: Are you telling me to get into this and have fearful
   experiences, Father? 

Gendo: Yes. 

Shinji: What! I won't. What are you saying now?! Father, can't you
   need me? 

Gendo: I called you out of necesity. 

Shinji: Why me? 

Gendo: Nobody but you can't. 

Shinji: I can't. I can't do that because I've never seen it nor heard
   it. 

---
Shinji: No. I knew it. I remember. I knew Eva. And then I ran away
   from Father and Mother.

THE THIRTIETH DAY 

---
Operator A: At present, the temperature is kept at 36. 

Male Operator: Electromagnetic radiation pulse is normal. Wave
   pattern is B. 

Female Operator: Every instrumentation unit is working normally. 

---
Maya: Making the outline of salvaging project in just one month. Only
   Senpai could do it. 

Ritsuko: What a shame that I didn't make the original plan. These are
   the data which came from the experiments done 10 years ago. 

Maya: Did such an accident happen during the development of Eva. 

Ritsuko: It was the accident before I joined Nerv. I heard that my
   mother was there. I know it just by the data. 

Maya: What was the result? 

Ritsuko: They failed, I heard. 

---
THE THIRTY-FIRST DAY 

---
Shinji: Comfortable. Warm. This is human warmth, isn't this? I've
   never had it. 

---
Rei: What is loneliness? 

Shinji: I've never known it. But I seem to know it. 

Rei: What is happiness? 

Shinji: I've never known it. But I seem to know it. 

Rei: Are others kind to you? 

Shinji: Yes. 

Rei: Why? 

---
Shinji: It's because I'm a pilot of Eva. They are kind to me because
   I get into Eva. It's the reason why I can stay here. It's all
   which support me. So I must get into Eva. 

Rei: Get into. 

Shinji: Enemy. Yes, I must fight against the ones which everyone
   calls enemies. 

Rei: Fight. 

Shinji: I must win. Yes, I mustn't lose. I must get into Eva as they
   say and I must win as they say. Otherwise, nobody, nobody, nobody
   ... 

---
Misato: Do your best. 

Misato: Hang in there! 

Asuka: What are you doing?! Do it right! 

Toji: Knock'em dead! 

Kensuke: Good luck! 

Gendo: Well done, Shinji. 

---
Shinji: Misato-san, Ritsuko-san, Asuka, Toji, Kensuke and Father
   praise me. They praise me because I get into Eva. The fellow like
   me. Everyone tells me to get into it. Father does. I'll show him
   what I can do. 

---
Misato: Do your best. 

---
Shinji: I'm doing my best. I am. Please be kind to me. I've been
   fighting so much. I'm fighting as well as I can. Take care of me,
   please. Be kind to me! 

---
Misato: I'm kind to you. Well, Shinji-kun. Do you want to become one
   with me? Do you want us to become one both mentally and
   physically? That's so comfortable. I'm ready. I'm always ready. 

Asuka: Hey, idiot Shinji. Do you want to become one with me? Do you
   want us to become one both mentally and physically? That's so
   comfortable. I'm saying like this. Come on! 

Rei: Ikari-kun. Do you want to become one with me? Do you want us to
   become one both mentally and physically? That's so comfortable.
   Ikari-kun. 

Misato: Do you want to become one with me? 

Asuka: Do you want us to become one both mentally and physically? 

Rei: That's so comfortable. 

Misato: Come on, now. Fell easy. Make your mind free. 

---
Female Operator: All search needles were driven in. 

Male Operator: Electromagnetic wave pattern is fixed at 0, -3. 

---
Maya: Ego-border pulse was connected. 

Ritsuko: Roger. Begin to salvage him. 

Makoto: Roger. Signal-1 is sent. 

Shigeru: Eva received the signal. 

Maya: Now, signal-2 and signal-3 is sent. 

Male Operator: XXXXX is under the nomal condition. (Wadakun: I can't
   find any word) 

Female Operator: Destrude isn't detected. (Wadakun: 'Destrude' isn't
   true) 

Ritsuko: Roger. Move the target to stage-2. 

Misato: Shinji-kun. 

---
Shinji: Ah. 

Asuka: Idiot Shinji! 

Shinji: Ah. 

Ritsuko: Shinji-kun. 

Shinji: Uh. 

Toji: Hey, Shinji. 

Shinji: Ah. 

Kensuke: Hi Shinji. 

Shinji: Ah. 

Rei: Ikari-kun. 

Misato: Shinji-kun. 

Asuka: Idiot Shinji! 

Ritsuko: Shinji-kun. 

Toji: Hey, Shinji. 

Kensuke: Hi Shinji. 

Rei: Ikari-kun. 

Misato: Shinji-kun. 

Asuka: Idiot Shinji! 

Ritsuko: Shinji-kun. 

Toji: Hey, Shinji. 

Kensuke: Hi Shinji. 

Rei: Ikari-kun. 

Misato: Shinji-kun. 

Asuka: Idiot Shinji! 

Ritsuko: Shinji-kun. 

---
Maya: No. His ego border is a loop fixedly. 

Ritsuko: Try to irradiate to all wave patterns from all directions. 

Ritsuko: No. The irradiated signals are captured in Clein space. 

Misato: What do you mean? 

Ritsuko: I mean, a failure. 

Misato: What? 

Ritsuko: Stop the interference. Reverse the tangent graph. Set the
   addition value to 0. 

Maya: Yes. 

Shigeru: In Q area, Destrude reaction is detected. Pattern is sepia. 

Makoto: As for the core pulse, some changes are detected. Plus 3 is
   confirmed. 

Female Operator: The water temperature is getting higher. 36, 38, 41,
   58,76, 97, 106... 

Ritsukko: Maintaining the present condition is the top priority
   issue. Present flowing back. 

Male Operator: The internal aproaching work. Over the estimated
   value. It's going into the dangerous area. 

Maya: Yes. Plus 0,5, 0,8. It's strange. I can't stop it. 

Ritsuko: What does it mean? You don't want to come back, Shinji-kun? 

---
Shinji: I can't get it. I can't get it. I, I ... 

Misato: What do you want? 

Asuka: What do you want? 

Rei: What do you want? 

Yui: What do you want? 

---
Maya: Eva rejected the signal. 

Shigeru: His ego formation in LCL is breaking up. 

Makoto: In the plug, the pressure is getting high. 

Ritsuko: Stop all operations. Cut the power supply. 

Maya: No. The plug is exited. 

Misato: Shinji-kun! 

---
Shinji: Ah! 

Shinji: This place? 

---
Shinji': In Eva. 

Shinji: In Eva? I've got into Eva again, haven't I? Why? 

---
Misato: You won't get into Eva any more? 

Shinji: I've decided that I'll never get into Eva any further? 

Misato: Nevertheless, you did. Into Eva-01. 

Shinji: Ah! 

---
Misato: Shinji-kun, you are here because you got into Eva. Because
   you got into Eva, you became what you are. You can't deny that,
   the fact that you got into Eva nor what you were, your past life. 

Shinji: I, I ... 

---
Misato: (wailing) What a nonsense the science which can't save even a
   person. 

---
Shinji: Smell. I smell someone. Misato-san? Ayanami? No, it doesn's
   smell them. I got it. It smells Mother. 

---
Gendo: It is a pity that his child will live after the Second Impact. 

Yui: Well. If he want to live, anywhere becomes the heaven. Because
   he really lives, he will find the chances for happiness anywhere. 

Gendo: I see. You may be right. 

---
Shinji: Mother. 

---
Yui: Have you decided? 

Gendo: I'll name it Shinji for a boy, Rei for a girl. 

Yui: Shinji, Rei. 

---
Shinji: Mother. 

---
Misato: (weiling) Shinji. 

---
THE THIRTY-THIRD DAY 

---
Ritsuko: Repairment of Unit One will be finished the day after
   tomorrow. 

Misato: Finally, human beings use even the God's power as a tool. 

Ritsuko: I don't know. The committee is also discussing freezing
   plan. 

Misato: Human-made-human Evangelion. Although it was made by humans,
   don't you think the black box is too large? I'm satisfied because
   Shinji-kun was finally saved. 

Ritsuko: It's beyond my ability. It's thanks to you, perhaps. Well,
   how about having a drink after a long time? 

Misato: Sorry. Yeah, well ... you know. 

Ritsuko: I see. 

---
Misato: Bye. 

Ritsuko: After she knew that Shinji-kun was safe, she has a secret
   meeting with a man. I've got no room to talk. 

---
Misato: I'm sure that Ritsuko is despising me as indecent woman now. 

Ryoji: Those who are hooked on sexual desires are more real as
   humans. Then we may deceive them a little. 

Misato: Our intelligence agency? Commander Ikari or Ritsuko? Or me? 

Ryoji: No, me. 

Misato: Others ... I'm right? You aren't interested in others but you
   feel lonely. You're really like my father. 

Ryoji: Cigarette. You still smoke. 

Misato: I smoke only after a thing like this. So only you know this. 

Ryoji: I feel honored. 

Misato: By the way, 

Ryoji: Do you meet me because you want to know that. 

Misato: Yeah, that's one of the reason. I'm honest, don't you think? 

Ryoji: The honor would be entirely mine, if a lady would make a
   cat's-paw of me. 

Misato: At present, it's important that I let you know my hope. What
   is the true goal of Nerv and Commander Ikari? 

Ryoji: It's I that want to know that. 

Misato: Wait, dodge my questions by doing such a thing. No, don't put
   such a thing in. Well, what are you doing in such a time? 

Ryoji: Here is a present for the first time in eight years. 

Misato: Wha? 

Ryoji: I'm afraid that it's the last one. 

---
Trail: Fuyutsuki is taken away by Seele. His past recollections
   which cross his mind. Kyoto in 1999. Everything started then. Can
   Nerv be a fortress for human beings? Next episode is
   "Nerv was born" .

Episode 21: nerf the berth.
----------------------------------------------

Misato:         Kidnapped? Our vice commander was?

Staff:          Its' 2 hours before now.
                He has been missing after he was at the eighth district
                in the west.

Misato:         That's inside of this installation.
                You, people of the division of intelligence, did nothing
                against that?

Staff:          There is an insider who spied and lead that.
                We were outwitted by that person.

Misato:         The guy who can baffle the Second section of Intelligence
                division.
                That is, 

Staff:          Kaji Ryouji, the person who is suspected to be the leader
                of this incident.

Misato:         That's why you came here to me.

Staff:          You help us alot because you understand quickly.
                We really regret to suspect the chief of planning
                as your colleagues.
                However, this is our job.

Misato:         Considering the carrier of me and him, this is a quite natural
                consequence.

Staff:          Thank you for your cooperation.
                Take this lady.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fuyutsuki:      It's long since last time, Chairman Kihl.
                This is a very brutal manner of welcoming me.

Kihl:           Commander is not necessarily to be here.
                In order to discuss with you for long, this is the natural
                consequence.

Fuyutsuki:      You never changed. You don't take my situation into account.

Seele 07:       The problem addressed at the moment is emergent.
                This consequence is inevitable.

Seele 03:       Please understand that.

Fuyutsuki:      Not the committee, but Seele finaly appeared.

Seele 07:       We have no intention of creating a new god.
                We hope your cooperation, Prof. Fuyutsuki.

Fuyutsuki:      Prof. Fuyutsuki...

----------------------------------------------

        1999 A.D. Kyoto

----------------------------------------------
Students:       Teacher, Teacher!

Fuyutsuki:      Oh, are those you.

Students:       Ow about drinking beer around Kamogawa river.

Fuyutsuki:      again?

Students:       Ryouko and others syes thye'll come if you come.

Students:       Professor also syes you must come more often.

Fuyutsuki:      Alright. I see.

----------------------------------------------

Professor:      It's not bad to drink outside in some opportunity.

Fuyutsuki:      Well,

Professor:      You are talented, though it's not good for you 
                to underestimate the importance of the communication
                among people.

Fuyutsuki:      I am Sorry.

Professor:      By the way, there's a student who wrote an interesting report
                on biotechnology.
                The student named Ikari,... do you know?

Fuyutsuki:      Ikari? No.

Professor:      I told the student about you. then the student said 
                "I wish to see him."
                You will receive a contact from the student.
                Please see the student.
                
Fuyutsuki:      The name is Ikari-kun, I see. 

----------------------------------------------

Fuyutsuki:      I've read this.
                There are two, three questions, though a quite stimulous
                report.

Yui:            Thank you so much.

Fuyutsuki:      You are Ikari Yui-kun.

Yui:            Yes.

Fuyutsuki:      What are you going to do from now on?
                You are going to join some commercial company, or to join this
                lab.?

Yui:            I've never considered about that.
                And, there may be the third choice.

Fuyutsuki:      hmm?

Yui:            I am also thinking about joining a home,
                I mean, if there's a nice person.

-----------------------------------------------
        2015 A.D. Again.
----------------------------------------------
02:             Incorporating S2 engine by itself, it obtained
                the ultimate existence.

04:             Evangelion Unit One.

03              The concretized GOD by us.
                Inpure 'tis.

Kihl:           The creation of a god is not allowed.

Some seele:     I don't allow him to have a god.
                Ikari Gendou, Is he a trustable person?

------------------------------------
Fuyutsuki:      Rokubungi Gendou?
                Well, I heard of the name.

-------------------------
        1999 A.D. Again.
-------------------------

Fuyutsuki:      Well, I've never seen him, though the guy is a rumour maker.

        Kyoto Prefectural Police Office.

Fuyutsuki:      Eh? I was appointed to his surety?

Fuyutsuki:      Yes. I will visit.
                When is it appropriate to visit?

Rokubungi:      I heard of your rumour from someone. I've wished to see you.

Fuyutsuki:      You were drunk and fought, what a cheap guy.

Rokubungi:      Before I spoke, I was picked one-sidedly.
                I am not used to be liked, while used to be haten.

Fuyutsuki:      That has sort of nothing to do with me.

Rokubungi:      Teacher Fuyutsuki, I am sure you are just the kind of
                person that I've expected.

Fuyutsuki(mono):His first impression to me was "disgusting guy."
                And in those days, this country still had a season, Autumn.

------------
Fuyutsuki:      Is that true?

Yui             Yes. I am going along with Rokubungi-san.

Fuyutsuki(mono):When I heard of that, I could not hide my surprise.

Fuyutsuki:      You walk together with that guy?

Yui:            Oh, Teacher Fuyutsuki, he is a very cute man,
                though everyone is ignorant of that.

Fuyutsuki:      Ignorance may make us happy.

Yui:            I introduced you to him. Were you disturbed by that?

Fuyutsuki:      Well, I admit that he is an interesting guy, though
                I don't like him.

Fuyutsuki(mono):However, it was commonly accepted by the people inside that
                the objective of his aproach to her was her talent and
                the backbone system behind her.
                The system was called "Seele" according to the rumour I heard
                afterwards.

-------------------------------
        2000 A.D. Antarctica.

Fuyutsuki:      The Second Impact--in the last year of the twentieth century,
                that tragedy took place.

        2001 A.D.

Fuyutsuki:      In the first year of the twenty first century, there was 
                nothing but time. A year that has no other word to say.

Fuyutsuki:      Was this the land of ice.
                Nothing suggests that.

Gendou:         Professor Fuyutsuki.

Fuyutsuki:      Oh, it's you. You survived?

Fuyutsuki:      I hear that you participated that Katsuragi investigation 
                commission.

Gendou:         Fortunately, I had returned to Japan the day before that
                incident, and I espaped from the tragedy.

Fuyutsuki:      Is that so, Rokubungi-Kun

Gendou:         Excuse me, I changed my surname.

Fuyutsuki:      Post card? Not name card?


                We married.
                Ikari Gendou
                      Yui

                It's long since last time. How are you?


Fuyutsuki:      Ikari, Ikari Gendou.

Gendou:         My wife asks me to give you this.
                Your fan is she.

Fuyutsuki:      I am honoured.


                Ikari Gendou
                      Yui

                It's long since last time. How are you?


Fuyutsuki:      How is Yui-kun? Doesn't she participate this tour?

Gendou:         She wished to come, though she has a child now.

Fuyutsuki:      Your system, called Seele something, is making a lot
                of dishonourable rumours.
                I don't appreciate the way that it controles the committee
                by force.

Gendou:         You are still scrupulous.
                In this age, no clean system can survive.

Fuyutsuki:      If this official investigation commission were
                arranged only by Seele people, there would be a lot of
                troubles.
                We are assigned to avoid the trouble?

--------------------------------
Misato:         I still hate darkness.
                That reminds me of notthig but horrible things.
----------------------------------
Fuyutsuki:      Who is she?

Staff:          The only surviver of that investigation commission.

------------------------------------
                2002 A.D.

        Southpole observatory ship, Second bulkhead.

Staff:          Her name is Katsuragi Misato.

Fuyutsuki:      Katsuragi? Is she the daughter of Dr. Katsuragi?

Staff:          Yes. She's never spoken for these two years.

Fuyutsuki:      How bad.

Staff:          She saw that hell (to be silent).
                Physical injury was cured, while mental injury is hard to
                be cured.

Fuyutsuki:      That's right.           

--------------------------------------

Fuyutsuki:      It's hard to figure out the result of this investigation.
                This giant of light, is nothing but mystery.

Fuyutsuki:      Afterwards, The United Nation officially 
                published that the Second impact was due
                to a massive meteoric colision.

Fuyutsuki:      However, for me, it was obviously a controled information.
                Behind that, there were Seele and the person named Kihl.
                I tried to know the truth of that incident,

----------------------------------------------
        2003 A.D. Hakone.
----------------------------------------------

        The Artificial evolution lab. directly controled by the United Nations.

Fuyutsuki:      even if the name "Ikari Yui" is on the way to that.

Fuyutsuki:      Why you hide the existence of the giant.
                The Second Impact had been, didn't you know,
                already known to you guys that it took place that day.

        Chief Ikari Gendou

Fuyutsuki:      You told me that you returned the day before the incident.
                Was it also a good luck that you returned carrying all the
                materials together.

Gendou:         I did not expect that this kind of things had not yet been
                disposed.

Fuyutsuki:      I investigated your estates in detail.
                I understand you need much money to educate a child.
                But the amount is too big to be possessed by a person.

Gendou:         Oh, what a great professor Fuyutsuki, How about moving
                to the faculty of Ecconomy.

Fuyutsuki:      The issues behind the second impact, you Seele and the
                Deadsea scroll will be publishd by me.
                I don't forgive the people who caused that.

Gendou:         As you like it. yet before that, I have one thing to show you.


------------------------------------------------------------
Fuyutsuki:      We are getting down this depth.

Gendou:         Are you afraid of that?

Fuyutsuki:      Slightly.

Fuyutsuki:      This is,,,

Gendou:         Someone not we left this area behind,
                thought 89% was buried.

Fuyutsuki:      Then, this was originally a sphere-shaped underground area.

Gendou:         That is the installation consuming all that human beings have.

----------------------------

Akagi:          Oh, Teacher Fuyutsuki.

Fuyutsuki:      Akagi-kun, you are also here.

Akagi:          Yes. This is the best place to grope the fundamental theory 
                of bio-computer we are targetting.

Fuyutsuki:      hmmm.

Akagi:          I am going to name these Magi.

Fuyutsuki:      Magi, the three wisemen from the east.
                Is that what you wanna show me.

Akagi:          No. This way.
                Ritsuko, I'll be back soon.

-----------------------

Fuyutsuki:      This is,,
                This is that giant?

Akagi:          We, Gehirn, call that object, Adam.
                This is different. 
                
Fuyutsuki:      Then, 

Akagi:          Yes, Facta de Adamo per hominibus est Eva.

Fuyutsuki:      Eva?

Gendou:         Our project of reviving Adam, commonly called Project E.
                This is the model of the project, called Eva Unit Zero.

Fuyutsuki:      The prototype of a GOD?

Gendou:         Fuyutsuki, let's make a new era of humanity together with me.

Maya:           Hi, Senior.

Ritsuko:        Oh, sorry. Let's hurry the Rei's re-test.

Maya:           I've never seen Katsuragi-san, today.

Ritsuko:        Well, Neither have I.

-----------------------
Ritsuko:        Katsuragi-san?

Misato:         Yeah, Katsuragi Misato, Nice to meet you.
-----------------------
        2005 A.D.
        Nagano Pref. Second New Tokyo City.

------------------------
        University of Second Tokyo, in the campus.
-----------------------
Ritsuko:        Mom, the other day, I happened to make an acquaintance with
                a girl named Katsuragi.
                People always look at me from distant places.
                That makes me remember the graveness of your name.
                She is different. She is quite frank even to me.
                I hear that she is the only surviver from that investigation
                commission.
                She seems to have once been aphasic. However, now that she
                is quite talkative just like she is trying to recover 
                the aphasic days.
        
Akagi:          Ritchan, I am always underground.
                I am tired of having the provided lunch box. 
                On the ground above, the construction of Third Tokyo City
                has started according to the second captal transfer plan.

Ritsuko:        For a couple of days, Misato had been absent from school. 
                I forced her to confess why. She is like an idiot!
                She had been in the bed with her boy friend in her flat,
                without being tired of, for one week long.
                I was impressed to know another side of her.
                Today, she introduced me the guy.
                He is handsome, though I am not used to that frivolity.

Akagi:          You've long since been afraid of boys, Ritchan.
                That's because you were educated only by a mother,,
                Sorry, I've always let you as you liked.
                I hate myself. I am your mother only when I wish to be.

Akagi:          Mother...

        Hakone, Second Underground installation for Experiment.
----------------------

Fuyutsuki:      How come here is a child.

Akagi:          This is Chief Ikari's son.

Fuyutsuki:      Ikari. This is not a day nursery.
                Today is a very important day.

Yui:            Sorry, Teacher Fuyutsuki. It's me that brought him here.

Fuyutsuki:      Yui-kun, This is your experiment today.

Yui:            That's why. I want to show the promising future to my child. 

Akagi:          That was the last word from Yui-san.
                The irregular insident erased her from this world,...
                Just as I had wished.
                What a disgusting woman I am.
                Ritchan, after that day, Chief Ikari completely changed.

------------------
Fuyutsuki:      Where were you going for this one week?
                I know how you are depressed.
                But your body belongs not only to you.

Ikari:          I know. From today, I start the new project.
                I've already proposed to Chaiman Kihl.

Fuyutsuki:      You are going to do that?

Ikari:          Right.
                The way to be a god, that nobody has accomplished.
                The instrumentality of Man project.

        2008 A.D.
------------------------------------

Ritsuko:        Mom, congratulations for your having completed the basic theory
                of Magi.
                I have a good news for you as the congratulations for you.
                It was informally decided that I will officially join Gehirn.
                From the next month, I will be engaged in Project E.

Gardian:        Who are you?

Ritsuko:        Akagi Ritsuko at Technology Development Devision.
                This is my ID.
                I hear that the basic installation of the commander's room 
                was completed, so I came here to see.
                Well, it's just like a maze here.

Gardian:        In the commander's room, you will see Chief and Dr. Akagi.

-------------------
Akagi:          Are you alright?

Ikari:          I don't regret my job.

Akagi:          Lie! You still remember Yui-san.
                But, I am OK with that.

-----------------------------------
        2010 A.D.
-----------------------------------

Ikari:          That is Gehirn head quarter.

Akagi:          Chief, good morning.
                You are accompanying your child?
                Oh, but should be a son...

Ikari:          This is not Shinji. I decided to take care of my acquaintance's
                child. Her name is Ayanami Rei.

Ritsuko:        Reichan, hello!

Akagi:          This child [looks like] someone.
                Yui-san?

-------------------------------------
Akagi:          All the files concerning Ayanami Rei have already been deleted.
                White paper.
                What does that mean?

Male voice A : An imaginary story  became true.   What a fate !
                               The proponent herself was the guinea pig.

Male voice B :  So, you say that contact experiment was the direct cause.
                                          
Male voice A : The mental breakdown.
                           Was that the result of the contact ?

Male voice A : But, how cruel it is !   She committed suicide leaving such a
                      little girl.

Male voice A : Ah, maybe, I don't suppose that it's the only one cause.
                    
--
Kyoko : My honey, Asuka, Mama cooked your favorite for you.
              If you say you likes and you dislikes, that girl will laugh you.

-

Female doctor : Everyday, she's like that.
                          She talks to the doll thinking it her beloved
daughter.
                                       
Aska's father : She might feel the responsibility in her way.  She devote all of
             her life to the research work, and did not afford to take care
of her daughter.

Female Doctor : I sympathize with your grief.

Aska's father : But, they are like a doll mother and a doll daughter.
                Maybe, there is very small difference between human and
               dolls.

Female doctor :   Dolls are made by humans copying their own shape.
                If God really exists, we might only be dolls for him.
                                
Asuka's father : From what you said, I cannot believe you are the doctor of
                        modern medicine.

Female doctor : A-ha, yes, I am a doctor,  but sill I am more a
                        human, and a woman than a doctor.

Announce : Medical Staff meeting for the E incident will be held on time.
                 All staffs in charge come to the second meeting room.

--

Aska's grandmother : You are so great, my Asuka.
                                  You may cry when you want.


Asuka : It.s O.K.  I will not cry.  I will think by myself.

--
Ritsuko : Do you hear me, Asuka ?  Your Synchronous ratio decreased
               as much as 8.   Don't think about extra things.
              Do as you do usually.

Asuka : I am doing so.

--

Episode 22
Don't be.

--
Maya : Recently Aska's synchronous ratio has been decreasing lower 
             and lower.

Ritsuko : That troubles a lot !  We have no spare.
          After all we should do the Rei's Unit-1 first.
          We cannot repair both of them at the same time.

--
     
Female operator A : The mitosis process of the left arm of Unit-2
                               cleared the numerical goal.

Male operator A : The necrosis process is presently under 0.05%.

Female operator B : There is no problem in the apothosis process.

--
Female operator C : For the self-formation system of Unit-0, keep the
                               present status
 
Female operator D : Connect each receptor to the second signal terminal.
  
--

Misato : (monologue)
              (What was born from Adam, that is series of Evas.
               We  have no other way to defeat the Angels without utilizing the
               very cause which lead to the Second Impact.
               In other words, those who utilize even the thing that tried
to destroy
              themselves, they are the human beings.)


Misato : After all, probably I hate Eva.  Probably I am trying to avenge my
father.


Makoto : Major Katsuragi !

--
Misato : They started the construction of the Evas until Number  13 ?
             In seven places all over the world ?

Makoto : This information came via Shanghai.
              The source is reliable.

Misato : Why they hurry up building in this time ?
                   
Makoto : We lost the two Eva Units recently, and presently another 
             two Units got severely damaged.
             I suppose they hurry the reinforce of the spare force for
              the second arrangement.

Misato : Who knows ?
             Even for us, we got the parts from Germany which were
             originally made for Unit-5 and 6.
             Nowadays they spend much money.

Makoto :  Lately the budget was doubled.
               From that, we may say the executives were driven into
               a corner.


Misato : I feel the Committee's impatience.

Makoto : So, do you think they are doing so because they are 
               supposing the cases of not single Angel as past, but 
               the simultaneous multiple Angel's attack ?

Misato : Hooom...    But there are no reason for them to do
             informally.   There should be another aim.

--
Misato :   Although it's been long since we were together last.
                But what is this unsociable atmosphere ?

Asuka : I finished.


RING ! RING!

Misato : Asuka !

Asuka : I don't take that call !   After all, maybe it's the call from Kaji-san
          to Misato.  Misato should take that.

Misato : That can not be ...

Asuka : Oh, I really regret that I made Unrivaled Shinji do such a 
             trivial job.

Shinji : Hai, Hello...

Asuka : Hey, I don't like the formal way as he does.
 
Asuka : Ah !

Shinji : An international call from Germany to Asuka.
             It's your mother.

Asuka : Me  ?   From Mother ?   Hand me the phone !
           Hello, Mutter,


Shinji : (Monologue )
              ( Listening her speaking unfamiliar language,
                I feel as if Asuka were a stranger.)


Shinji : Mother....
-

Asuka : ..........Gute Nacht !


Shinji : It's a very long phone call.

Asuka : Hum !  It's only a sort of  usual communication.


Shinji : I envy. Family talk...

Asuka : Oh, it looks...
          It's only superficial look.   She is not my true mother.

Shinji : Oh !

Asuka : But, It doesn't mean I dislike her.
          Only I feel a little uncomfortable with her.
          Ah !  What's the hell, I tell you such a thing!

Shinji : Sorry.

Asuka : HOOOM !    It's the last day for me when I received a
           sympathy from you !

--

Maya : Synchrograph, minus 12.8.    It's on borderline of the
          starting indicator.

Ritsuko : What a terrible status !
               Her results are more worse than yesterdays.

Misato : Asuka is under a bad condition.  She is during the second
             day of that .

Ritsuko : Synchronous ratio doesn't get affected by the external
               body disorder.

             (Monologue)
              (Maybe we have to change the Unit-2 pilot.)

              Asuka, you may finish.


--
Announce : Maintenance of Power system No. 8 is going to
                 start at 18 : 00 this evening.

Announce : The regular meeting on the first commanding center
                  project will be held on time.
                  The personnel of the general affairs department gather
                  to the meeting room NO. 2.

Ritsuko : Aska's pride was severely damaged.


Misato : It's a natural course, after beaten in that way.
             Moreover, much worse is that she feels as she was             
       
             beaten by Shinji.
             Maybe it's our limitation.  I'm afraid we three could not
             live together.

Ritsuko : Break through the critical point ?
               It's the end of nice family game ?

Misato : I won't allow to say that phrase from you who conceal her
             loneliness with cats.

Misato : Oh, I am very sorry !
             I'm slightly upset.

--
Asuka : Why should I experience such an untorelable time because
           I am female ?  I need no kids.
                           
--
Announce : The circular route No.7 is now closed because of an
                 accident.   Please use the root No. 12 instead.

Asuka : Haa ?  Hooom.

--
Rei : Without opening your mind to her, Eva doesn't move.
       
Asuka : So you mean I am shutting myself ?  Me ?
 
Rei : Yes.   Eva has her own mind.

Asuka : That doll has ?

Rei : You must be aware of that.
                  
Asuka : Haan !   Today is so special day as you, even from you, talked to
          me.  Tomorrow maybe we will have snow.
          Damn !  You are so delighted that I can't drive Eva ?
          Don't worry.  when an Angel comes, the invincible Shinji will
          defeat it.
           Nothing we must do.
           They just need only Shinji !
           If Shinji is there, everything is OK.
          A-ha !  It's the most terrible thong that not only Shinji, but a
doll like
          you sympathize with me.

Rei : I am not a doll.

Asuka : Shut up !  You do anything as you're ordered.
           You will kill yourself if Commander Ikari orders you to do so.

Rei : Yes, I will.

Asuka : Haa !

-
Asuka : After all, you are just a doll !
           You have looked like a doll, and I have hated you from
           long, long time ago.
            Mmm, Heee !   I hate everyone !  Everyone  !

Asuka : Mmm, heeee...

--
Kensuke : Shinji is absent today, too.
               Ayamami's absence is usual, but....

Hikari : Neither Asuka .
            Suzuhara is still in the hospital.
  
Kensuke : Now I suppose that the situation is very severe, and they can't
               come to school.

--

Male operator B : For the signals of EVA Unit-2, everything
                          is OK.

Female operator E : Connection and Fusion of VA is within
             normal limit.
            The field of proliferate is within the expected range.

Asuka : You are just my doll.
          So move as I order and don't say NO.
          Why a weapon has the mind ?  Obstructive !
          Anyway, you must say just " Yes " to my order.
          Hum ?   Foolish !

Shigeru :  All personnel, the combat formation of first kind.
                Prepare for the attack from sky!

Asuka : Angel !   Still they come ?

              Don't Be.
---B PART---

Shigeru : Angel was certified by vision.
              It's at maximum zoom.

Makoto : It doesn't move from the satellite orbit.

Shigeru : That keeps the constant distance from us.
 
Misato : That means,  that is waiting for the chance of
             coming down, or that is going to destroy us without
             approaching ?

Makoto : We can't act easily.

Misato : Anyway, we can do nothing  unless that approaches to 
             within our firing range.
             Eva cannot beat the enemy over the satellite orbit.
             How's Rei  ?

Maya : She and Unit-0 is on good condition.  They are OK.

Misato : Roger.   Unit-0, Sortie!  Prepare for the very-long-
             distance firing.
--
              Unit-2, Asuka, be ready to the sortie for
               covering.
 
Asuka : Covering ?  Me ?  For Unit-0?

Misato : That's right. Take the rear guard
 
Asuka :    That must be a joke!  Eva Unit-2, sortie.

--

Ritsuko : Asuka !
--

Misato : OK.  Allow her in the front as she wishes.

Makoto : Major Katsuragi !

Ritsuko : You mean if Asuka fails here, she will be dismissed.
 
Maya : That means, it is the last chance for her ?
  
Ritsuko : We have to prepare in case of the change of
               Unit-2 Pilot.

Maya : Yes, Ma'am.

Makoto : By the way, don't you sortie Unit One?

Misato : It's being frozen by  Commander Ikari's absolute order.

              (monologue )
              (We must accept it after such an accident...)

--
Asuka : If I fail this mission, maybe I will lose the position
           of Unit-2 pilot.   You must not make any mistake,
           Asuka.
--
Shigeru : Target is still out of the firing rage.

Asuka : Oh, hurry up, come here, you lazy Angel !
           Your laziness irritate me !

Asuka : A-HA !

(BGM : "Hallelujah chorus " from "Messiah" by Haendel)

--
Misato : Enemy's directional weapon ?
   
Shigeru : No, no thermal energy reaction detected.

Maya : Abnormal patterns in Psychograph.
          Mind contamination will start soon.

Ritsuko : Angel's psycho-attack ?
               Can they understand the mind of human beings ?

--
Asuka : Damn.....

--
Female operator  F : ..... diminished.

Shigeru : No effect.  It is out of the range.
 
--
Asuka : Akuh , Wu-aaa...

--
Shigeru : Unit 2 has no bullet in its rifle.

Misato : How is the ray analysis result ?

Makoto : Energy wave of the visible wave length.
             It's similar to AT field, but the details are still
             unknown.

Ritsuko : How's Asuka ?

Maya : Dangerous situation.
          The mind-contamination broke into the borderline.
--
Asuka : No !   Me !   Don't enter into me !

Asuka : Ouch !

Asuka : Ouch !

Asuka : Ouch-ii !

Asuka : Ou !

Asuka : No !

Asuka : No-oo !

Asuka : No !

Asuka : Don't peep into my mind !

--
              Please !  Don't invade into my mind anymore.

Misato : Asuka !

Maya : Her psychograph is at the critical point.

Ritsuko : Her mental circuit is now getting damage  so
               terribly.
              Further overload will be  too dangerous.

Misato : Asuka, retreat !

--
Asuka : No !

Misato : It is the order.
             Asuka, I order you to retreat.

Asuka : No, Definitely, No !
          If I must retreat, I'd rather die here.

--
Misato : Asuka !

--

Male operator C : Accelerator, start the synchronization.


Female operator G : Voltage is increasing. Approaching to
             the pressure range.

Male operator D : Compulsory Focusing start !

Female operator H : Correct the error from the rotation and
                gravity of the earth, 0.03.

Operator : Pressure in the barrel is at the maximum point.

--
Makoto : Release the final safety lock.
              All personnel, prepare for the firing !

Rei : Ooo !

--
Shigeru : No effect !    Energy is too short to break
               through the AT field from this long distance.

Makoto : But, output  power is at its maximum.
              We cannot have greater power.

Maya : Unit-2,  Psychograph signal is very weak.

Ritsuko : How the mind barrier of LCL acts ?

Maya : No effect.  We cannot even expect the buffer effect.

Ritsuko :  Give the first priority to Life support.
                Don't allow the back current from Eva.

Maya : Yes, Ma'am.

Ritsuko : (monologue)
              (That ray seems to scan Asuka's mental wave length
               pattern.   Oh, no, does this mean Angel is trying to
               search the human mind ?)

--
Little Asuka : Wu-ahhn........

Asuka : Why am I crying ?
          I decided that I would not cry anymore.

--
Asuka's father : What, Asuka.  It's the present from your
                       new mother.  Isn't it your favorite ?

Little Asuka : No.

Asuka : So, what do you want ?

Asuka : I am not a baby.    I will be an adult earlier than
          other people.  I don't need a huggy bear.

Little Asuka : So, see me.
                    Mama, please,  don't stop being my mother.

Kyoko : Please come to the heaven with me.

Little Asuka : Mama, Mama, Please, Don't kill me.
                    No !
                    I am not a doll of Mama.
                    I will think by myself, and  I will live by myself.
                    I need not Daddy or Mama.
                    I will live alone.

Asuka : No !  Don't make me remember such a thing !
           I wanted to forget, so don't dig my memory !
           I don't want such a terrible memory.
           Stop !  Stop !

--
Asuka : Got dirty, my mind has.
           Kaji-san, it's polluted.  What should I do !
           My mind was polluted !
 
--

Female operator I : Unit-2, all activity ceased.
                                          ceased

Female operator J : A problem arose in the life support
              system.

Maya : The pilot will enter in the dangerous zone.

Shigeru : Target, no change.
               Relative distance shows still no change.

Makoto : The possibility that target will move into the firing range
             of Unit-0 is 0.02 %.

Misato : Transport Unit-0 by air ?
             Shoot the target from sky ?
             No, we can't do that.
             If the Angel shoot Unit-0 during the approaching, we
              can't protect.

Shinji : I will take the field with Unit-1.

Misato : Mmmm......

Kouzou : No. This target is the one who invade into the mind of
              pilots.

Gendou : We must avoid the situation that Unit-1 is invaded, now.

Shinji : So you mean it's OK if I am not defeated.

Gendou : That is not guaranteed.

Shinji : But, in this situation, Asuka will ....

Gendou : OK. I don't care.
             Rei, go down the DOGMA and uses the Lance.

Kouzou : Lancea Longini ?    Ikari, That is.......

Gendou : We have no choice to destroy the target on the satellite orbit
              where AT field cannot reach from here.
             Hurry !

Misato : But, there is the possibility that the contact of Adam and Eva
             will cause the Third Impact.   That's too dangerous.
              Commander Ikari, please do not do that !

Misato : (monologue)
            (That isn't a true story?  That is a lie?
             The Second Impact was not caused by the contact with Angel.)
--
Female operator K : Open the areas from No. 10 to No. 15 of the Central
             Dogma.  Unit-0 passed the No. 6 Malvoisie.
             Next, open the areas from No. 16 to No. 20.

--
Misato : You say the third impact will not be aroused by such a little
             thing.   So, what is the real cause of the second impact ?

--
Kouzou : Ikari, I think it is too early to use that.

Gendou : The committee started the mass production
              of Eva series.  It's a good chance, Fuyutsuki.

Kouzou : But, I cannot...

Gendou : We cannot make the clock's arm move backwards,
              but, we can make them move earlier by our hands.

--
Kouzou : The Old Men will not allow this.

Gendou : We must end the all of the things before SEELE take
             an action.
             It's not a good idea to lose Unit-2 at the moment.

Kouzou : But. if we use the Lancea Longini without the permission
              from SEELE, that will arise many problems.
-
Gendou : If the reason exists, that is enough.  There's no other reason
           to have a reason. 

Kouzou : Reason ?  What you really want is just an "excuse".

Makoto : The amplitude of EEG (Electroencephalograph) of Unit-2
             pilot,  decreased to 0.06.

Maya : It's the critical point for Life Support.

Shigeru : Unit-0 passed No.2.  She will be come over the
              ground.

--
Misato : That is Lancea Longini.

Shigeru : Unit-0, take the position for throwing.

Makoto : Confirm the target.
             Correct the error, OK.

--
Maya : Start the countdown.
          10 second before zero.
           8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

--
Rei : Hiii !

--
Shigeru : Target deceased.

Maya : Eva Unit-2 will be free.

Kouzou : How about Lancea Longini ?

Makoto : It passed the first space speed.
              It is now moving to the lunar orbit.

Kouzou : It's almost impossible to scavenge that.

Makoto : I agree.  There is no way now to take that amount
              of mass back.            
--

Maya : Unit-2 is all right.   Graphs are within normal limits.

Shigeru : Collect the Unit into Cage NO.2.

Female operator L : Use the route No. 67.

Misato : How's Asuka ?

Makoto : The pilot is alive, confirmed.

--
             The quarantine  for the contamination is over.

Misato : I see...

--
Shinji : I am glad as you are OK, Asuka.

Asuka : Shut up !   What you called OK ?
          It's the most terrible thing that I was rescued by that
          girl !   Rescued by that dammed girl !
          I rather prefer to die than this.
          I hate, hate, everyone, everything !

Evangelion Episode 23

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryouji:         Katsuragi, this is me.
                I'm sure you are listening to this message after I have
                troubled you so much. Sorry.
                Please say "I am sorry" to Ritchan.
                And there's one more thing that will trouble you.
                I've been taking care of flowers.
                I am glad if you water the flowers for me.
                Shinji-kun knows where they are.
                Katsuragi, the truth is with you.
                Don't hasitate. Go ahead!
                If I can see you again, I will say the word that I could not
                say 8 years ago. Ciao.

Misato:         The telephone which does not ring...

        On BUSINESS
        Sorry, but don't call me.

Shinji:         Misato-san's shutting herself up today as ever. 

        Permitted Person ONLY
        If you enter without my permission, you shall die!

        Eintritt Verboter!

Shinji:         Asuka, she isn't getting back today?

-----------------------------------------

Hikari:         She neither go to school, nor go home,
                playing game for all day.

Asuka:          Hikari, let's go to bed.

Hikari:         Yeah.
-----------------

Asuka:          Sorry, I am disturbing you.

Hikari:         You are not.

Asuka:          I did not win with Eva.
                I lost all my values at any places.
                I hate, I really hate, I hate everybody,
                though it's myself that I hate most.
                I,,, now that I care nothing, I have nothing to do.

Hikari:         I think, you may do anything you like.
                I don't blame you.
                I really think you've done well.

Asuka:          [weaping.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ritsuko:        Well, that child is gone.
                hmm, probably.
                Even a cat die.
                Don't cry, grandmom.
                Hmm, I will come home when I have a time to.
                I've never been to my mom's grave for these three years.
                Next time, I will phone to you.
                OK, I quit.

Ritsuko:        Well, that pussy died.

Seele:          Lancea Longini is impossible for us to scavenge.

Seele:          Why did you use that?

Seele:          Regarding Eva series, we don't have all those scheduled.

Gendou:         The annihilation of the Angel was more important.
                There was no other way.

Seele:          No other way?  Your excuese should be more persuasive.

Seele:          The things you did recently are too impressive.

Gendou:         Fuyutsuki, I am discussing.
                Alright.

Gendou:         An Angel is approaching at the moment.
                The rest of discussion will be done at the next opportunity.

Seele:          If your chair remains.

Seele:          Ikari, are you going to betray Seele?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Misato:         I'll arrive 15 minutes later.
                Launch Unit Zero from 32nd gate.
                Set Unit Two to back-up (to cover).
                No, I have no right to cancel the freeze of Unit One.
                Ciao.

Misato:         Angel recognized in sight.. 

------------------------------
Announce:       Unit Zero, sortie! To the intercept position.

Makoto:         Unit Two, wait at the present position.

Gendou:         No, sortie.

Makoto:         Commamder!

Gendou:         I allow. That must be useful as a decoy at least.

Makoto:         Y, Yes sir!

-----------------------------

Announce:       Unit two, be ready to sortie.

Asuka:          I am on board again as usual.
                Oh, no, I am still attatched to this?

Announce:       Unit Two, To the eighth gate.
                Sortie, as soon as the launching position is determined.

Asuka:          Oh well, even if I sortie, only I can do is to disturb others.

Announce:       Target approaching. Passing by the final defense line at Goura.

Asuka:          I don't care anything, any more.

-----------------------------------------------------

Announce:       Target floating above Oowakudani Valley,
                Revolving at the fixed position.

Makoto:         Target's AT Field is still active.

Ritsuko:        What have you been doing?

Misato:         I don't excuse.
                Present status?

Shigeru:        Still under the deadlock condition.

Makoto:         From pattern blue to orange, turning cyclicly.

Misato:         What does it mean?

Maya:           Magi is presenting that it is impossible to answer.

Shigeru:        The data is insufficient to get an answer.

Ritsuko:        But that shape is, I am sure, not a fixed shape.

Misato:         We cannot attack from our side.

---------------------------------------------------

Misato:         Rei! We watch the status for a while.

Rei:            No. It's coming.

Misato:         Rei, accept battle!

Makoto:         NO! NO TIME.

Shigeru:        Target physically contacted to Unit Zero.

Misato:         Unit Zero's AT Field is?

Maya:           developing, but being penetrated.

Ritsuko:        That Angel is positively trying the first level contact
                to Unit Zero?

-----------

Maya:           Danger! Unit Zero's Bioparts are being penetrated.

Misato:         Eva Unit Two, Sortie! Make her rescue Rei, and cover.

-------------------------
Maya:           progressing, and penetrating further.

Ritsuko:        Dangerous. 5 percent has already been bio-fused.
------------------

Misato:         Asuka, approach 300 more, and develop A.T. field,
                fire the palette gun aiming at Target's back part.
                Alright?
                Eva Unit Two, Lift off!

Misato:         Sortie! Asuka! What's wrong?
                Unit two's status?

Maya:           No way, Syncro ratio is under 10%.

Misato:         Asuka!

-------------------
Asuka:          Does not move, Does not move!
-------------------

Misato:         This way, she will be a victim.
                Retrieve!
                Immediately!
---------------------

Rei:            Who? Me? Me within Eva.
                No, I feel someone else than me.
                Who are you? Angel?
                The being that we call Angel?

Rei:            Don't you be unified with me?

Rei:            No.
                I am I, not you.

Rei:            Hmm, but you shall.
                It's too late.
                I give you part of my mind.
                I give you this emotion.
                Pain, see, your mind has a pain.

Rei:            Pain? no, something different.
                Loneliness.
                Yes. lonely.

Rei:            Lonely?
                I don't understand.

Rei:            You hate being alone?
                We are many,
                though you hate being alone.
                That's called loneliness.

Rei:            That's your mind. Full of sadness.
                That's your own mind.
----------
Rei:            These are tears. It's I that is crying.

-------------------------
Misato:         Rei!

Gendou:         The freeze of Unit One is cancelled right now.
                Sortie as soon as possible.

Misato:         Eh?

Gendou:         Sortie!

Misato:         Yes sir!

--------------
Asuka:          What's that? Last time, he did not use that for me.

-------------------------
Misato:         Develop AT Field, Rescue Rei! Immediately!

Shinji:         Yes!

-----------------
Rei:            Ikari-kun!

Shinji:         Ah!

Rei:            This is my mind, 
                which wish to be unified with Ikari-kun.
                No!

Maya:           AT Field Reversed.
                being Penetrated at once!

Ritsuko:        To hold Angel?

Misato:         Rei! abandon the Unit and escape!

Rei:            No, If I escape, AT field will disappear.
                So, I don't [escape].

Misato:         Rei, going to die?

Maya:           The core is collapsing, breaking through the critical point.

People:         WOW,,,

Shigeru:        Target disappeared.

Misato:         The operation finished right now.
                Move to the alert of the first kind.

Makoto:         Understood. Move to the Situation Yellow, immediately.

Misato:         Unit Zero's status?

Maya:           Entry plug ejection not recognized.

Misato:         Rescue the surviver.

Ritsuko:        You mean, if there is [a surviver].

Misato:         uggg.

                Dispose the parts concerned.

Staff:          Understood.

Staff:          Do it immediately.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Seele:          At last we defeated the Angels up to 16th.

Seele:          Now that there's only one Angel left,
                which is described in DeadSea Scroll of Seele.

Seele:          The promised time is nearby.
                The road has been long, with many victims.

Seele:          Aye. After losing Lancea Longini, We lost Eva Unit Zero.

Seele:          That's a sufficient reason to dismiss Ikari.

Seele:          He must understand why we returned Fuyutsuki alive.

Seele:          A new sacrifice is needed, against Ikari.

Seele:          And, the one must know the truth.

Shinji:         Misato-san. Never come out the tears.
                I think I am sad, but never come out the tears.

Misato:         Shinji-kun, all that I can do for you is this.

Shinji:         Stop!
                No, Misato-san.

Misato:         Sorry.
----------

Misato:         Although he must be lonely, maybe he fears a woman.
                No, he fears the communication with people.

Misato:         PenPen come to me.

Misato:         I see, anybody will do.
                It's me that is lonely.

                Dr. Odani, please contact to The Second Conference Room

Shinji:         I'm glad, You are alive!
                My father is not here?
                Thank you! You saved me.

Rei:            What?

Shinji:         You saved me even by abandoning Unit Zero.

Rei:            Oh, I did save you?

Shinji:         Yeah. Don't you remember that?

Rei:            No, I mean, I don't know that.
                I think, probably, I am the third.

        402 Ayanami

Rei:            Are these tears?
                I see these for the first time,
                but it does not seem to me for the first time.
                I, am I crying? Why crying?

-----------------------------------------------------------

Gendou:         That's right.
                Preserve the present status for First Children.
                No need to capture.

Fuyutsuki:      Yet, if they know Rei is alive,
                Chairman Kihl and others will blame us.

Gendou:         To those oldmen of Seele, I will present something else.
                No problem.

------------------------------------------------------------

Seele:          We wish to proceed peeceably.
                We don't wish you to suffer from insults anymore.

Ritsuko:        I don't feel any insult.

Seele:          Strong-tempered woman.
                It's quite natural for Ikari to keep her nearby.

Seele:          However, it is no one but Ikari who presented you to us.

Seele:          Rejecting the interrogation to the pilot of Unit One,
                He presented you as her deputy, Dr. Akagi.

Ritsuko:        I am Rei's deputy?

        Sorry, but don't call me.

------

Ryouji:         The way to the truth, which you wished was sent by the other
                36 methods, to you. But those will not reach you.
                The guaranteed is only this capsule.
                This is all that I have.
                It's absolutely up to you how to use this.
                The passcode is our first memory.
                Ciao, take care.

Misato:         I ain't irritated anymore by the telephone that does not ring,
                since I received your mind.

----------------------------------

Seele:          Is it OK about the Dr. Akagi's disposition.

Seele:          Different from Fuyutsuki.
                It's better for us to return her.

Seele:          She rendered remarkable service to Eva series.
                She should be useful for us for a while.

Seele:          Aye. For the future of humanity.

Seele:          Regarding Evangelions, Eight of those are under construction.

Seele:          Four more have not.

Seele:          The disappear of the Third New Tokyo City will enhance
                the project.
                Hurry the completion.
                The promised day will be that day.

----------------------------------
Shinji:         Hi, Hello.

Ritsuko:        Listen to me.
                You are free from secret service at the moment.
                You can go out right now.

Shinji:         Ritsuko-san,,

----------------------------------

Ritsuko:        mm?

Misato:         No use, without my pass.

Ritsuko:        I see. Kaji-kun arranged that?

Misato:         The secret of this place must be revealed before my eyes.

Ritsuko:        Alright. And this child will see that as well.

Misato:         Alright.

------------------------------------------------

Shinji:         This looks just like Ayanami's room.

Ritsuko:        Ayanami Rei's room. 
                This is the place where she was born and bred.

Shinji:         In this room?

Ritsuko:        Yes. Her birth place.
                Light and Water which consist Rei's deep mentality reflect
                the image of this place.

Misato:         Dr. Akagi, I did not come to see this.

Ritsuko:        I know. Misato.

----------------------------

Shinji:         Eva?

Ritsuko:        First one. A failure. Disposed 10 years ago.

Shinji:         The tomb place for Evas.

Ritsuko:        Nothing but a dumping ground.
                This is also the place where your mother disappeared.
                Probably you don't remember, but you were watching that,,
                watching the moment when she disappeared.

Shinji:         Aha!

Misato:         Ritsuko!
---------------------------

Misato:         You say this is the core of dummy plug?

Ritsuko:        I'll show you the truth.

Shinji:         Ayanami Rei,,
                Aha!

Misato:         You say Eva's dummy plug is,

Ritsuko:        Yes. These are about to be the core of dummy system.
                This is the factory for manufacturing these.

Misato:         This is?

Ritsuko:        These are dummies.
                And nothing but the parts for Rei.

                Humans found a god, and thus, tried to obtain that.
                As the result, punished were humans. That was 15 years ago.
                Vanished the god that they found.
                They, however, tried to revive the god by themselves.
                That was Adam. Made from Adam to be close to the god was
                a human.
                Eva is that.

Shinji:         Human?
                Is that a human?

Ritsuko:        Yes, that's a human.
                Eva which did not have a soul ab initio,
                now that, has a human soul.
                All of these are  salvaged.
                However the vessel which truly contains a soul is Rei.
                Only she has a soul.
                No other vessels have a soul.
                There was nothing within the room in the canvass.
                These Rei-like things here do not have a soul.
                Nothing but vessels.
                So I destroy them, because I hate them.

Misato:         Do you know what are you doing?

Ritsuko:        Yeah, I know. Destruction.
                These are not humans, but are humanshaped things.
                I lost against THE THING. I could not win.
                When he is in my mind, I can bear any insult.
                I don't care about my own body.
                But he, he did, ...
                I knew that.
                I am stupid, I am as stupid as my mother. Very stupid.
                You can kill me, if you wish.
                I am glad if you do that.

Misato:         You are more stupid if you wish so.

Ritsuko:        (crying.)

Misato:         A tragedy of the people possessed by Eva.
                I am also one of them.

Will be continued.

                "Neon Genesis Evangelion: Episode 24"
                Translated Speech Script.

                Translated by Kentaro ONIZUKA
                From the script captured by Kenji MATSUOKA

Introduction

Eva, these days, is chaotic. Just like "2001 A Space Oddyssey."  Those
who can figure out the last chaotic and seeming-to-be-meaningful
scenes in the "2001" might understand the recent storyline of Eva.  It
seems that the question "What is the 'Instrumentality of man Project'"
has already been answered. But what? Merging the soles of all people
by making pickles within LCL?

Comments and corrections to the script are welcome.

Episode 24

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asuka:          Mom! Mom!
                They selected ME!
                I'm an elite pilot about to protect mankind.
                No.1 in the world.
                Secret to anybody.
                But I tell you mom!
                Everybody is so kind to me
                that I ain't lonely.
                I am OK though I don't have my father.
                Look at me! Me!
                Hey Mom!
--
Asuka:          Syncro rate Zero.
                I've no capacity to be the second children.
                I've no reason to exist.
                No one looks at me.
                Neither daddy, mom, nor anybody [cares me].
                No reason for me to live.

Staff:          You are Soryuu Asuka Langray?
--
Makoto:         Second section of Inteligent Division says
                the second children was captured alive.

Misato:         I see.
                They found her 7 days after they missed her.
                That isn't like them.

Makoto:         Maybe on purpose, then.
                They are trying to trouble us, the planning division.

Misato:         Might be.
                (And, today, the fifth will arrive for Asuka.
                Too much arranged scenario.)
--
Shinji:         Ayanami Rei,
                That may be true... that impression.
                My mom's ..
                Rei and my Mom, ,,
                What is my daddy doing for these two.

--
Ritsuko:        Commander Ikari,
                My cat died,
                which my grandmom had been taking care of.
                I hadn't been taking care of it for long.
                Suddenly now that I cannot see it again.

Gendou:         Why did you destroy the Dummy System?

Ritsuko:        It's not the dummy system, but Rei that I destroyed.

Gendou:         I ask you once more.
                WHY!

Ritsuko:        Now that I ain't happy even if you hold me.
                You can do anything you like to my body,
                as you did at that time.

Gendou:         I was disappointed by you.

Ritsuko:        Disappointed?
                You have neither the expectation nor wish to me.
                I have, nothing, nothing ...
                what shall I do, mom..
                
--
Shinji:         Where has Asuka been.
                (What should I talk with her?
                Story about Ayanami?)

--
Shinji:         (Touji, Kensuke lost their house here and went to somewhere.
                No friend, I have no friend here.
                No one.
                I don't want to see Ayanami.
                I lost the courage to see her.
                How shall I behave before her?
                Asuka, Misato-san, Mom,
                What Shall I do? What!

A boy:          hmmmm,,mmm
                A song is good!

Shinji:         Eh?

A Boy:          A song supplies us with joy.
                A song is the highest culture that Lilims generated.
                Don't you think so?
                Ikari Shinji-kun?

Shinji:         You know my name?

A Boy:          Everyone knows your name.
                Excuse me, but you'd better know your own standpoint.

Shinji:         Is that so?
                Well, who are you?

A Boy:          I'm Kaoru.
                Nagisa Kaoru (Kaoru of Seashore.)
                Just like you are, I am one of the arranged children.
                The fifth children is me.

Shinji:         Fifth children!?
                Are you? Nagisa-kun?

Kaoru:          Call me "Kaoru," Ikari-kun.

Shinji:         Alright, call me Shinji.

Kaoru:          (Laugh)

Makoto:         Reportedly the fifth children has just arrived.

--
Misato:         Nagisa Kaoru (Kaoru of Seashore).
                The record of his life has already been deleted, like Rei.

Makoto:         One thing we know is that his birthday is the very day
                of the Second Impact.

Misato:         Committee directly sent him to us.
                He has something.

Makoto:         The issues of Fifth in Malduk report has no permission for
                publication.
                For these reasons, I secretly investigated the data in
                the Inteligent division.

Misato:         Oh, you risked too much.

Makoto:         That risk was worthful.
                I've got where Ritsuko-san is.
                How are you going to do the syncro-test of Fifth?

Misato:         Today I don't have any plan to cheat.
                Let's see his capability.

--
Fuyutsuki:      Down 0.3 more.

Maya:           Yes sir.

Fuyutsuki:      Is there any mistake in this reading?

Makoto:         The tester system is operating normally.

Maya:           No data error detected by Magi.

Fuyutsuki:      It's surprising that this boy syncronizes with unit two
                before replacing the core.

Maya:           Yet, I can't believe.
                I mean, it's impossible on the system.

Misato:         Nevertheless that's the fact.
                We must accept the fact and then investigate the cause.

--
Kaoru:          You are, the First Children?
                Ayanami Rei.....
                You are the same as me.

Rei:            Who are you?

--
Fuyutsuki:      I hear that fifth boy contacted Rei.

Gendou:         Is that so?

Fuyutsuki:      Magi are doing their best to scan the data of Fifth.
--
Misato:         Yet, we haven't yet known what he really is.
                What is he, that boy?

--
Penpen:         quaquqaa

Misato:         Shinji-kun has not yet returned.
                I am disqualified as his guardian.

--
Announce:       Central Dogma is being opened at the moment.
                Use 3d route for the transfer.

Shinji:         hm?

Kaoru:          Hey.
                You were wainting for me?

Shinji:         Oh, no I did ,, I don't mean so.

Kaoru:          Today is?

Shinji:         Well, the usual test was over and,
                I am going to have a shower before I go home.
                Yet, I don't want to go home these days.

Kaoru:          You have a house, or home to go. That fact makes you happy.
                That's nice.

Shinji:         Is that so?

Kaoru:          I want to talk with you more.
                May I go with you?

Shinji:         Eh?

Kaoru:          I mean shower.
                Aren't you going to shower?

Shinji:         Yeah,,

Kaoru:          You say "no"?

Shinji:         Oh, yes. I don't mean NO.
--
Kaoru:          Extremely avoiding the contact of the first kind are you.
                You fear to feel other people?
                Being ignorant of others, you will ever be neither betrayed
                nor hurt, though you never escape from feeling sadness.
                A person cannot erase sadness forever.
                Everyone is alone.
                However, peaple can forget, thus able to live.

Shinji:         Oh!

Shinji:         That's the time.

Kaoru:          It's over?

Shinji:         We have to go to bed.

Kaoru:          Together with you?

Shinji:         Oh, well, you have your own different provided room.

Kaoru:          Well, people always feel pain at the heart.
                The heart is easy to have a pain, that's why living is painful.
                Particularly, fragile like a glass is your heart.

Shinji:         Me?

Kaoru:          Worth being favourable.

Shinji:         Favourable?

Kaoru:          I mean, I love you.

Seele:          NERV, the system established to act under us.

Seele:          Founded to play our scenario.

Seele:          Now that it was exclusively occupied by a person.

Seele:          Aye. We must take it back.

Seele:          Before the day of promise.

Kihl:           Let NERV and Eva-series be as they should be.
                Ikari, you are responsible of betraying us, Seele.
--
Gendou:         The time remaining us is short.
                And, now that we don't have Lancea Longini that would prevent
                us from accomplishing our hope.
                The final angel will soon appear.
                When we erase that, our hope will come true.
                Wait a little, Yui.
--
Rei:            Why am I here?
                Why am I still alive?
                For what?
                For whom?
                The Fifth children.
                He looks like something same as me.
                Why?

--
Misato:         We are lucky because we live in the suburb of the town.
                You were not involved, I'm glad at that.
                Yet, next time, I cannot garantee that.
                So, you will be taken care at Horaki-san's from tomorrow.
                So long, PenPen.

PenPen:         Quaa, quaquauu.

Misato:         (Sigh)

--
Kaoru:          I say, I should be on the floor.

Shinji:         Oh, you need not. It's me that asked you to let me here.
                I'm OK that I sleep here.

Kaoru:          What are you going to talk.

Shinji:         Eh?

Kaoru:          You have something that you want me to hear.

Shinji:         I've experienced many things after I came here.
                I was at my teacher's before.
                Silent and calm days.
                I did nothing but exist.
                It was OK with me.
                I had nothing to do.

Kaoru:          You dislike people?

Shinji:         Well, I don't care people.
                except for my father that I hate.
                (Why am I talking about this kinda things to Kaoru-kun?)

Kaoru:          (Laugh)

Kaoru:          (Sigh)

Kaoru:          I might have been born to meet you.
--
Misato:         How is it? You've got HIS data?

Makoto:         Here you go.
                I borrowed this from First Lieutenant Ibuki without
                her permission.

Misato:         I am sorry for that I made you do something like a thief.
                What's this?

Makoto:         It's quite natural that Maya-chan cannot publish this.
                That's theorically imppossible.

Misato:         Hmm, yes.
                Mystery increases.
                He can arrange any syncro ratio freely, at his own will.
                We must do anything without considering how others see us.
--
Ritsuko:        You dared to come here.

Misato:         I have one thing to ask you.

Ritsuko:        The conversation here is being recorded.

Misato:         I don't care.
                That boy, the Fifth is what?

Ritsuko:        Probably,.. the final messenger.
--
Kaoru:          Here we go.
                Come on, Adam's alter ego, and the servant of Lilims.

--
Makoto:         Eva Unit Two started!

Misato:         What's the hell!
                Asuka a?

Shigeru:        in the hospital room 303.
                It's confirmed.

Misato:         Then who is ...?

Maya:           [Unit Two is] unmanned.
                Entry plug not being inserted.

Misato:         Unmanned?
                Isn't it the Fifth?

Makoto:         A.T. Field generation detected in Central Dogma.

Misato:         Unit 2?

Makoto:         No, Pattern is Blue.
                No doubt. That's an ANGEL!

Misato:         Oh no!
-
Misato:         Angel?
                Is that boy?
-
Operator:       The target passing by the fourth layer.
                Still descending.

Shigeru:        No way.
                Cannot disconnect the power supply to the Linear motor car.

Operator:       The target passing by fifth layer.

Fuyutsuki:      Close all bulkheads in the Central Dogma!
                Gain any time.

-
Operator:       Close all layers to the direction Five o'clock.
                All personnel, Evacuate. All personnel, Evacuate.

-
Fuyutsuki:      Seele dared to directly send to us.

Gendou:         That Oldman is trying to advance the schedule, by the
                instrumentality of us.

--
Seele:          The final angel invaded into the Central dogma.
                Descending at the moment.

Seele:          Just according to our schedule.

Kihl:           Ikari, you were our good friend and brother sharing the same
                will and our coorperator who understands us.
                This is the last job.
                We hope you carry out with Unit One.

--
Shigeru:        The armoured bulkheads are broken through by Eva Unit Two.

Makoto:         The target passing by the second layer.

Gendou:         Eva Unit One pursuit!

Misato:         Yes Sir!

Gendou:         Use any method.
                Don't allow the target to invade the Terminal dogma.

-
Misato:         But why that Angel uses Unit two?

Fuyutsuki:      Is he trying to unify Unit Two?

Gendou:         Or to lead an destruction.

--
Shinji:         NO NO NO, MUST BE A LIE!
                Kaoru-kun is an Angel?
                That MUST BE LIE!

Misato:         That's true. Accept the fact.
                Sortie, Alright?

--
Kaoru:          Shinji's not yet come.

--
Operator:       Eva Unit One, descending through ROUTE 2.
                Pursuiting the target.
--
Shinji:         You betrayed me!
                You betrayed my mind!
                You betrayed like my father!

--
Shigeru:        Unit One reached the fourth layer.
                Contacting the target.
--
Shinji:         You are here.

Kaoru:          I've been waiting for you.

Shinji:         Kaoru-kun..

Shinji:         Asuka! Sorry!

Kaoru:          Evae, factae de Adamo, the beings detested by people.
                Nevertheless, Lilims are trying to survive
                by the instrumentality of those.
                I don't figure out why.

Shinji:         Kaoru-kun STOP!
                I don't see Why.

Kaoru:          Eva is made of the same body as mine.
                Because I am also the natus de Adamo.
                When the unit does not have a sole, I can unify.
                Now that the sole of this unit is shutting itself.

Shinji:         A.T. Field!

Kaoru:          Yes. You, Lilims, call it so.
                The holy region that must not be invaded by anyone. 
                The light of mind.
                You, Lilims, are aware of that.
                Aware of that A.T. Field is the wall of mind that anyone has.

Shinji:         I don't understand that! Kaoru-kun!

Shinji:         GU,,GAAAAA,,
--
Operator:       Both Eva units reached the last layer.

Operator:       20 for the Target to the terminal dogma.

Misato:         When something happens after the signal from 
                Unit One disappears,

Makoto:         I know. 
                You are going to self-explode here.
                It's better than to let Third Impact take place.

Misato:         I'm sorry.

Makoto:         Not at all, I can die with you.
--
Kaoru:          The destination of people?
                The hope of people is the thread of sadness.

--
Misato:         What's that?

Makoto:         The strongest A.T. Field we ever know.

Shigeru:        Light wave, electromagnetic wave and particles are shut out.
                We can monitor nothing.

Misato:         That's barrier?

Maya:           The Target, Eva Unit two, and one, all missing.
                Cannot connect to the pilot.

--
Shinji:         gggggg,
                Kaoru-kun!

Shinji:         Wait!

--
Shigeru:        The final safety system released.

Makoto:         The heaven's door is opening.

Misato:         Arrived the Angel?
                Hyuuga-kun!
--
Shinji          WOW!
                What!
--
Misato:         Status?

Makoto:         That's A.T.Field.

Shigeru:        Another A.T. Field similar to the previous one generated
                around the terminal dogma.

Maya:           Invading into the barrier.

Misato:         Does it mean another angel?

Shigeru:        No way.
                No, cannot confirm.
                AH! I mean, vanished.

Misato:         Vanished?
                Angel?
--
Kaoru:          Adam, our mother being.
                Those born from Adam must return to Adam?
                even anihilating people?
                No! Different.
                This is Lilith.
                I see. I've got it, Lilim.

Kaoru:          Thank you Shinji-kun.
                I wished you to keep Unit Two.
                Otherwise, I would live with her.

Shinji:         Kaoru-kun, why?

Kaoru:          I've been destined to live forever, although
                people are annihilated as the result.
                However, I am able to die.
                To be or not to be, that makes no difference for me.
                My death is the only absolute liberty.

Shinji:         What, What are you talking about?
                Kaoru-kun! I don't figure out what are you talking about!
                Kaoru-kun!

Kaoru:          My dying words.

Kaoru:          Now, please erase me.
                otherwise you will be erased.
                The living thing that escape the time of annihilation
                and that obtains the future is only one.
                And, you are not the one that must die.
                You need future.
                Thank you. I am glad to see you.
--
Shinji:         Kaoru-kun, said "I love you."
                To me!
                For the first time, for the first time I heard the words.
                He looks like me.
                He looks like Ayanami.
                I loved him.
                It is Kaoru-kun that must have survived.
                He was much better than I am.
                He should have survived.

Misato:         No.
                A surviver must have the will to survive.
                He wished to die.
                He abandoned the will to live, And depended on the false hope.
                You are not wrong.

Shinji:         You are cold, Misato-san.

Shinji:         Yes. It's Kaoru-kun that must have survived.
                He was much better than I am.
                He should have survived.

Misato:         No.
                A surviver must have the will to survive.
                He wished to die.

--
Shinji:         Evangelion Unit One.

Shinji:         I have to pilot this, after all,
                killing the one that I loved,
                obaying the words from my father and others.
                You say I must fight on this?
                Mom! say something! answer me!

--
                        Why pilot Eva?
-
Shinji:         'Cause People ask me to pilot.

-
                        So you pilot?
-
Shinji:         Isn't it OK? It's for the sake of everybody! Isn't it OK?

-
                        You pilot Eva for the sake of others?
-
Shinji:         Yes!
                That is a good thing.
                That is a very good thing.
                Everyone prases me, then.

Asuka:          That's a lie.
Shinji:         What?

Asuka:          You idiot?
                After all, it's for the sake of oneself.

Shinji:         Eh?

Asuka:          And you excuse yourself as usual.

Shinji:         Do I?

Asuka:          To think that you are doing your best for the sake of others
                is itself an easy way to live.

Shinji:         Is that so?
-
Asuka:          In other words, you are lonely, Shinji.
-
Shinji:         Is that so?

Asuka:          That's nothing but a dependent or symbiotic relationship.

Shinji:         That might be.

Asuka:          All you wish is that people depend on you.

Shinji:         That might be.

Asuka:          All you do is to wait for someone's giving you a happiness.
                A false happiness.

Rei:            That's the very thing you do.

Asuka:          WOW.
--
                        Soryuu Asuka Langray.
                        In her case,
-
Asuka:          I'm in Eva without my intention.
                I'm forced to be in this.
                This junk won't move!
                Oh, no, it's me that is a junk.

                Useless am I.
                No one needs me.
                No one needs the pilot who cannot pilot Eva.

Rei:            You are trying to find yourself within others.

Asuka:          Shut up!
-
                        Anxiety of separation.
--
Rei:            You fear being alone.
-
                        Anxiety of separation.
-
Rei:            You fear because you'd be erased together with others.
-
                        Anxiety of separation.
-
Asuka:          So piloting.
-
                        Action of attatchment.
-
Asuka:          Shut up!
-
                        Action of attatchment.
-
Asuka:          Shut up! Shut up!
                I don't wanna be told that by a doll like you!
--
                        The third character
-
                        Ayanami Rei, in her case,
-
Rei:            Who am I?

Rei:            Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Who are you?
-
                        Ayanami Rei
-
Rei:            You are also Ayanami Rei?

Rei:            Yes. The thing called Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            All these are the things called Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Why all of these are me?

Rei:            Because others call us Ayanami Rei.

Rei:            Why do you have a false mind and false body?

Rei:            Not false, for I am I.

Rei:            No. you are a human whose false sole was made by a
                man named Ikari Gendou.
                You are a false object which is pretending to be a human.
                Look, you have a dark, invisible, and uninteligible  mind
                within you, where the true you exist.

Rei:            I am I.
                I've become me in the instrumentality of the links
                between me and others.

Rei:            I've been formed by the intercouse with others.

Rei:            The intercouse with people and the flow of time change
                the shape of my mind.
-
                        Those are bonds?
-
Rei:            Yes. Those've formed me so far, the thing called Ayanami Rei.
                And, those will form me from now on.
-
                        Those are bonds?
-
Rei:            But, there's someone else who is the true you.

Rei:            You don't know her.

Rei:            Because you don't want to see that, you are trying to run away.
-
                        Because of fear.
-
Rei:            Because she might not have a human shape.
                Because the present me might disappear.
-
                        fear
-
Rei:            One fears that the self disappears.

Rei:            Fear?
                Doesn't make sense.

Rei:            The Self's world will disappear.
-
                        Don't you fear?
-
Rei:            Self will disappear.
-
Don't you fear?
-
Rei:            No, I'm glad.
                I am the thing that wishes to die.
                All I need is a dispare.
                I want to be a nothingness.

Rei:            No, no way.
                You can't be a nothingness.
                That person won't let you be a nothingness.

Rei:            Still not allowed to return.

Rei:            I've existed because he's needed me.

Rei:            But, the end.
                Useless will I be.
                Deserted by him will I be.

Rei:            I've hoped the day, although I fear now.
-
Gendou:         Let's go.
                You've existed for the sake of today, this day, Rei.

Rei:            Yes.
-
                        And,
-
                        The complimentaion
                        by the instrumentality of man
                        begins.

 Do you love me?
--B PART---
                        Shinji Again.
-
Shinji:         What feeling is this?
                That is what I feel like I experienced before.
                My body seems like dispearing.
                Agreeable.
                I feel like spreading, and becoming large,
                to here, there and everywhere.
-
                        That was the very begining
                        of the complimentation of the people
                        by the instrumentality of man.

-
                        Things people lost.
-
                        The lost minds.
-
                        Complimenting the vacuum in the mind.
-
                        The complimentation
                        by the instrumentality of minds and soul begins.
-
                        All things return to nothingness.
-
                        The complimentation
                        by the instrumentality of man
                        has just begun.
-
Gendou:         No,
                It's not that everything returns to nothingness.
                It's nothing but returning everything to the begining.
                Nothing but returning things to the mother which
                has long since been lost.
                All the minds become one mind, obtaining peace forever.
                Nothing but that.
--
Misato:         Is that the instrumentality of man project?

Ritsuko:        Right.
                We always have vacuum, something lost in our minds.

-
                        Those yeald the starvation within minds.
-
                        Those yeald anxiety and fear within minds.
-
Ritsuko:        Everybody fears darkness within one's mind,
                which one tries to escape from, tries to erase.
                That's how people live.
                But, nobody can ever escape from that.

Misato:         So you unify the people's mind and
                make them compliment each other?
                On your accord?
                You are poking your nose to other's business.
                That's nothing but a cheap friendship.

Ritsuko:        Yet, you are the one who's wished that.

Misato:         Really?

--
                        CASE 1
-
Misato:         Where am I?

-
                        (PART 1)

                        In the case of Katsuragi Misato

-
Shinji:         This is the me within your mind.

Misato:         At the same time, it's my mind within you, isn't it?

Shinji:         In ordert for me to find me, I have to feel many kinda people.
                I have to gaze inside of me.
                I have to gaze the Misato-san within me.
                What do you hope?
-
                        You wanna be a good child.

-
Misato:         Must I be a good child?

-
                        Why?
-

Misato:         Since I don't have a daddy
                Since I have to help mom, I must be a good child?
                But, I don't wanna be like you, mom.
                When daddy is absent, mom is always crying.
                Don't cry!
                Don't depend!
                So must I be a good child?
                So don't I wish to be disliked by daddy.
-
Misato:         But I hate my father.
                So do I dislike a good child.
                I dislike!
                I'm tired of
                keeping myself pure,
                keeping myself pretending to be pure.
                I'm tired.
                I wish myself to get dirty.
                I wished to see the me dirty.

Ritsuko:        So did you let him hold you?
                So did you let that guy hold you?

Misato:         NO!
                Because I loved him, I let him do.

Misato:         You truly loved him?

Misato:         Obviously!
                He accepted what I truly was.
-
                        Really?

-
Misato:         He was tender.

-
Misato:         NO!
                Don't show this to Shinji-kun!

Ryouji:         You don't have to be shamed of at the moment.

Misato:         I am shamed of.

Misato:         Why shamed?
                You can show to the guy you love,
                Moreover, you wish to show this.

Misato:         NO! Stop!

Misato:         You must be glad to show this to Shinji.

Misato:         NO!
                NO! NO WAY!

Misato:         I wonder,
                It's to your father that you wanna show this.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find a peace on Kaji-kun's face.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find a peace in Kaji-kun's kindness.

Misato:         NO!

Misato:         You tried to find your father in Kaji-kun's arms.

Misato:         NO!
-
Misato:         YES.
                I found the father within Kaji-kun back then.
                So fleed from him.
                I feared.
                He was just like my father.
                But, it was because I was happy,
                It was a joy.
                It was truly a enjoyable joy!
                So did I hate.
                So did I separate.

Ryouji:         No reason to begin a love, but a reason to end the love.

Misato:         You are kind enough,
                You are kind enough to, I hope, make me dirty.

Ryouji:         Don't hurt yourself only because you hate yourself now.
                That's only to cheat yourself by momentally punishing yourself.
                Don't do that.

Misato:         And "you must take care of yourself" say you?

-
Misato:         Guys always do so.
                And Guys work, and Guys go into their world,
                leaving me behind.

Misato:         Just like my father.

Misato:         Always trying to escape from the hardships in the reality.
                Hardship in the reality?
                It's me?
                It's me.
                Yes. It's me.
                It's inevitable.
-
Shinji:         Stop, Misato-san.

-
Misato:         I'm desparate of myself.
                I hate myself!
-
Misato:         Impure.
                Dirty!

-
Ritsuko:        Badlooking.

-
Misato:         Mean! Dirty!
                Is that the adults' intercourse? I really hate that!

-
Makoto:         Congratulations for you promotion. Major Katsuragi.

-
Misato:         The me appreciated is the me who is trying
                to play to be appreciated.
                It's not the true me.

-
Misato:         The true me is always crying.

-
Misato:         Yes. I am happy!

-
                        Am I happy?

-
Misato:         I am happy.

-
                        Am I happy?

-
Misato:         I am happy....?

-
                        Am I happy?
-
Misato:         NO!
                This is not a happiness!

-
                        What's a happiness?

-
Misato:         This is not true me!
                I am only trying to think so.

Shinji:         Otherwise, we cannot live?
-
Shinji:         We are unstable unless we are together.

Rei:            Unstable.

Ritsuko:        unless someone is in the same bed.

Asuka:          You fear to sleep alone?

Maya:           You are lonely to sleep alone?

Ryouji:         You cannot stand for the lost of minds.

Makoto:         Then, Anybody will do.
-
Misato:         NO!

Misato:         YES, you wish to get some simple joy.
                You are trying to cure your mind with the momentally escape.
                You are making use of GUYS.

Misato:         NO NO NO WAY!

-
                        At last, what does she wish?

--
                        CASE 2
-
Asuka:          Whare am I?

Shinji:         It's my mind within Asuka.

Asuka:          Then, it's my mind within Shinji.

-
                        In the case of Soryuu Asuka Langray.
                        Part 1

-
Shinji:         What do you hope?

-
Asuka:          I can live alone.
                I don't need either daddy or mom.
                I live alone.
                I don't cry anymore.

Asuka:          (crying)

Asuka:          Yet, I am crying.
                Why am I crying?

-
Step mother:    It's difficult for me to deal with that child.

Asuka's father: You worry? It's not like you who is a doctor.

Step mother:    A Doctor is a human,
                as I said before.

Father:         Well, still it's not like you against a kid.

Step mother:    She is quite adult in some case with the absolute rejection 
                with a tension, that I'm often afraid of.
                Don't you think so?

Father:         Well,
                Anyhow, you are Asuka's mother, after all.

Step mother:    I became your wife before that.

Father:         Simultaneously didn't you become?

Step mother:    Yes, in the viewpoint of social standpoint.
                However, I can quit being her mother at anytime, though
                you cannot quit being her father.

Father:         That's, sort of right.

-
Asuka:          NO! STOP!
                Don't quit being my mother!
                I'm going to be a good child whom you'd love.
                So, don't quit being my mother.
                So, look at me!
                Stop MOM, don't kill me!
-
Kyouko:         Your daddy now hates mom.
                Your daddy deserted me.
                Or, I knew, he's never loved me from the very begining.
                He have never needed me from the begining, I guess.
                So, let's die together with mom.
                Daddy does not need us.

Asuka:          Am I disturbing?
                Am I useless?

Kyouko:         I hope, let's die together.

Asuka:          NO!
                I'm not your doll.
                I can think by myself, I can live by myself.
-
Asuka:          At that time, Mom was hung from the cealing.
                She looked very happy.

-
Asuka:          But I hate her face back then.
                I don't wanna die.
                I don't wanna let myself disappear.
                I don't like boys.
                I don't like daddy, mom.
                I don't like anybody!
                Nobody protects me.
                Nobody is by me.

-
                        What does she wish?

-
Asuka:          So do I live alone.
                But I don't want that.
                It's painful.
                I don't wanna be alone.
                I don't wanna be alone.
                I don't wanna be alone!

-
Shinji:         Don't leave me.

Misato:         Don't desert me.

Asuka:          Don't kill me.

-
Shinji:         What's this?

Misato:         This is the instrumentality of man project that your father
                has been carrying out.

Shinji:         Is this?

Misato:         It's part of them, I think.

Asuka:          The truth is yet unknown to us.

Ritsuko:        The thing you perceive is the truth.

Rei:            Things within you.

Fuyutsuki:      And the things recorded in your memory will be your truth.

Ritsuko:        There is a truth that changes through the time.

Shinji:         This is the truth.
                The result of everything, is this?

Asuka:          Out of many truths, one is this.

Misato:         That's the result you wished.

Shinji:         I wished?

Rei:            Yes.
                The destruction, the world, where nobody would be saved.

Shinji:         NO. It's that nobody saved me.

Ritsuko:        Nobody can save you.

Ryouji:         This is what you wished.

Asuka:          The destruction, the death, the return to nothingness,
                All of these did you wish.

Misato:         This is the reality.

Shinji:         What's the reality?

Rei:            Your world.

Makoto:         With time, with space, with other people, the world of
                your own.

Shigeru:        The world where how to accept things and how to perceive things
                are absolutely up to you.

Maya:           It's your world only given to you at the moment,

-
                        That's the reality.

-
Misato:         Your world nobody can deal with.

Shinji:         It's the the world where everything is already set isn't it?

Ritsuko:        No, it's the world that you are setting.

Fuyutsuki:      The world that you are trying to set.

-
                        That's the reality.

-
Misato:         The will to live.

Asuka:          The mind that wishes to die, which you yourself wish.

Shinji:         This darkness, this incomlete world,,
                Do you say, all of these did I wish?

Asuka:          Yes.

Ryouji:         The closed world where nobody but you are confortable.
                That is the very world you wished.

Makoto:         To protect your weak mind.

Shigeru:        To protect your joy.

Maya:           This is the result from these.

Misato:         In the closed space with nobody but you in it,
                Nobody can live.

Asuka:          But you wished the world, the world closed to yourself.

Ritsuko:        Excluding what you hate, you wished the world of solitude.
                The mind of your own.

Rei:            That's your delivered world with small peace in the mind.

Asuka:          This is one of conclusion.

Misato:         The end of the world that you have lead.

                        And the way to the complimentation,

                "Neon Genesis Evangelion: Final Episode"
                Translated Speech Script
                        with Many Translated Subtitles

                translated by Kentaro ONIZUKA
                From the script captured by Kenji MATSUOKA

Introduction

I have nothing to say. Eva#26 the final Episode was a collage of
grafiti, and a collection of the words of the cult or sect leaders.
"The instrumentality of man project" was nothing but a brainwashing.

I have a good suggestion for those who read this scrit.  Replace the
name "Shinji" with "GAINAX", and replace "Eva" or "pilotting Eva" with
"The making of Evangelion", the resultant script will completely make
sense.

Now that it is obvious that the making of Evangelion itself has been
the excuse to make Evangelion, after all.

You might know that when A.D. Vision announced the international
release of Eva, it says someting like "Eva is under remake for the
international release. The resultant Eva will have the OVA quality."

I really hope the remake. At least the last two, three episodes should
be remade. Nobody wishes to buy LDs that contains exactly the same
scenes as the TV version.
# But I will buy.

In this sense, the video recorded TV show will be a very rare
collectors item.

The commments and corrections to the script are welcome.

Evangelion Final Episode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

                It was 2016 A.D.
        The thing people lost,
        in other words, the complimentation of the mind is on the run.
        However, it's too short a time to describe the entire process.
        Therefore, we discuss on the complimetation of the mind of
        one single boy named Ikari Shinji.

                Case 3: In the case of Ikari Shinji.

                        Fear

Asuka:          That I disappear.

Shinji:         Yet, I can disappear because I think I am useless.

Rei:            Why?

Asuka:          Because I am useless.

Shinji:         After all, I am a useless child.
                Nobody cares me.


Mistato:        You run away considering nobody cares you.
                You fear to fail.
                You fear to be disliked.
                You fear to see the weekness within you.

Shinji:         You too!

Misato:         Right. We are the same.

Ritsuko:        Our mind lacks something.

Asuka:          So We fear that.

Rei:            So we worry that

Misato:         So we are trying to be one.

Asuka:          We are trying to compliment
                by the instrumentality of earch other.

Rei:            That's the instrumentality project.

Fuyutsuki:      One cannot live without being surrounded by others.

Gendou:         One cannot live alone.

Ritsuko:        One is always unique.

Ryouji:         So, hard.

Asuka:          So, sad.

Misato:         So, one wish to feel others' mind and body.

Rei:            So wishes to be one.

Fuyutsuki:      A human is made of weak and fragile materials.

Ritsuko:        The mind and body are also made of weak and fragile materials.

Gendou:         So necessary is it to compliment
                by the instrumentality of each other.

                        Why?

Gendou:         There's no other way to live.

                        Is that true?

Rei:            Why do you live?

                        I've no idea.

Asuka:          I might live to know why.

Rei:            For whom do you live?

Asuka:          Obviously, for me.

Shinji:         Probably for myself.

                        Is that true?

Rei:            You enjoy your life?

Shinji:         I wonder.

Rei:            You enjoy your life?

Asuka:          Of course yes.

Rei:            You enjoy your life?

Misato:         I don't want to do anything not enjoyable.

Ryouji:         You dislike to be sad?

Shinji:         I don't like that.

Ryouji:         You dislike hardships?

Misato:         I don't like that.

Ryouji:         So you run away.

Misato:         Yes. Do you blame me who runs away from something
                I hate.

Shinji:         I don't run away.

Rei:            Why don't you run away.

Shinji:         If ran away, it would be more painful.

Rei:            You ran away from something painful.

Shinji:         It was painful.

Asuka:          You know the pain, then everything's OK.

Misato:         You may run away if painful.

Rei:            You can run away from something you truly hate.

Shinji:         Yet, I don't. I don't want to run away.
                No. I shall not run away.

Misato:         It's because you already know that running away results
                more painful.

Asuka:          You know how painful to run away.

Rei:            So you don't wanna run away.

Shinji:         I say, if ran away, nobody would care me.
                Don't desert me! I hope! Don't desert me!

Ritsuko:        obaying others words, that's his way to live.

Shinji:         Right! Otherwise, I would be deserted.

Asuka:          You fear to be hurt.

Misato:         You are trying to think so.

Kensuke:        Not only you but also others are hurt.

Touji:          Everybody feels hardships.

Hikari:         You think so, because it's easier for you.

Shinji:         Shut up! That's nothing to do with me.
                People don't care me.

Misato:         And you always desert your value.

Rei:            I have nothing.

Asuka:          And you try to think yourself valueless.

Misato:         Considering that, Doing nothing, one would not be hurt.

Asuka:          People try to keep themselves by being praised.

Shinji:         NO BODY ACCEPTS ME.

Misato:         You are trying to think so.

Shinji:         So, I have to pilot Eva.

Misato:         You've been trying to think yourself valueless since the 
                very begining.

Shinji:         I have to do so.

Kensuke:        No, it's not so.

Touji:          You trying to think so, anyway.

Shinji:         I am valueless. I have nothing to be prode of.

Asuka:          So piloting Eva.

Shinji:         Piloting Eva lets me be myself.

Asuka:          Piloting Eva lets me be myself.

Shinji:         Before piloting Eva, I had nothing.
                The fact that I pilot Eva lets me stay here.

Asuka:          I have nothing else.

Rei:            I have nothing else.

Shinji:         I have nothing. NOTHING.

                        The value to live?

Shinji:         No don't I have. I hate myself.

                        THUS,

Asuka:          I hate you! I hate you!

Touji:          Me hate you.

Kensuke:        I hate everything of you.

Hikari:         Sorry, but I hate you.

Ritsuko:        I hate you.

Makoto:         I hate you.

Shigeru:        I hate you.

Maya:           I hate everything of you.

Ryouji:         I hate everything of you.

Misato:         I hate you!

Shinji:         Now, everybody hates me.
                Probably, people hate me.

Rei:            You are trying to think so.

Shinji:         NO. Because I hate myself.

Rei:            So, you are trying to think others hate you.

Asuka:          I hate, I hate I hate you!

Shinji:         But, I am praised.
                I am praised when I pilot Eva.
                I was praised.

                        So, happy.

Shinji:         I was praised by people!

                But, not happy.

Rei:            Which is your true mind?

Shinji:         I don't know, or, both of them are my true minds.

Misato:         So piloting Eva.

Shinji:         I have nothing but Eva.

Rei:            Otherwise you cannot keep yourself?

Misato:         It's true that Eva Unit One is part of your mind.

Ritsuko:        If you depend on Eva too much,
                Eva itself will be yourself.

Ryouji:         Eva will be all of yourself.

Misato:         The true yourself will be nowhere.

Shinji:         It's OK. I've had nothing from the begining.
                I've been learning cello, but results nothing.

Asuka:          I did not try to do from your side.

Shinji:         But, now that I can pilot Eva.

Asuka:          And, when you lost Eva, you can do nothing, like me.

                        Why pilotting Eva?

Shinji:         Because it's all of me.

Shinji:         Rain, gloomy mood, just like my mood. I don't like that.

Rei:            The sinking sun, fading life, my hope. I don't like that.

Asuka:          Morning, the begining of today, the begining of
                a bad day. I don't like that.

Shinji:         Blue sky. Something warm, something not used to,
                something horrible. something useless. I don't like that.

Asuka:          I hate everybody!

Misato:         What do you hope?

                        Hate anxiety?

Asuka:          What do you need?

Asuka:          Don't hate me!

Shinji:         What I fear is,

                        Rejection

Rei:            What I need is,

                        Contact and Approval

Shinji:         May I stay by you?

Rei:            May I stay here?

Asuka:          Do you love me?

                        Your Mother,

                        Do you love her?

Asuka:          You wanna go your mom's

Asuka:          No, I don't.

Shinji:         Don't you wanna go your dad's?

Shinji:         No, I don't.

Rei:            Why not?

                        Because I fear.

Shinji:         I fear to be haten.

Asuka:          Because I would disappear.

                        So what?

Misato:         What do you wish?

                        Erasing anxiety.

Rei:            What do you need?

                        Erasing sadness.

Yui:            You are not happy arn't you?

Shinji:         Before that, I need. I need my value.
                In order to be appreciated, in order not to be 
                deserted,

                        I need my VALUE.

Yui:            That is what you must admit by yourself.
                You must admit your own value.

                        So piloting Eva.

Shinji:         I don't have any value.

Asuka:          I don't have the value worth living.

Rei:            Then, what are you?

Shinji:         Then what am I?

                        Where am I?

Shinji:         What the hell am I?

                        So, needs the blockade of mind.

Shinji:         What? It's me. The shape that I show to others,
                the symbol representing me.
                This, and this, and this all these are the representation
                of me. Nothing but the things that make others cognize me.
                What am I? This is me? The true me? The false me?

Rei:            You are you. Yet, you have your own region and border.

Shinji:         Let's see. My clothes, my shoes, my room.
                Those are part of myself.

Rei:            The things linked together by your will.

Shinji:         The thing that I think myself is me.
                I am nothing but myself.
                Yet, I don't understand. Where am I?
                What am I? What am I?
                Nobody understands me.

Asuka:          You idiot! That's matter of fact!
                Nobody ever understands you.

Misato:         The one that takes care of you, and the one
                that understands you is nobody but yourself.

Rei:            So, take care of yourself.

Shinji:         But still I don't have myself, so I don't understand myself.
                There's no way to take care of myself.

                        You are unstable.

Rei:            You are still unstable.

Misato:         The present you

Asuka:          The people around the present you.

Rei:            The environment that surrounds the present you.

Misato:         None of them doesn't last forever.

Asuka:          Your time always flowing.

Rei:            You are made of the changing world.
                You are the thing that may change according to 
                your own mind.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－

Shinji:         What? The world with nothing. The world with nobody.

Shinji:         The world of freedom.

Shinji:         Freedom?

Shinji:         The world of freedom that would never be restrained by anybody.

Shinji:         Is this Freedom?

Shinji:         Yes. The world of freedom.

Rei:            As the result, there's nothing.

Shinji:         unless I think.

Misato:         Yes, unless you think.

Shinji:         What's the hell! I don't know what I should do.

Rei:            You are uneasy.

Asuka:          You don't have your own image.

Shinji:         Too vague.

Misato:         Everything is vague.

                        That's freedom.

Ryouji:         The world that you can do anything you like.

Misato:         Yet, you are uneasy.

Fuyutsuki:      Don't you know what you should do.

Shinji:         What shall I do?

Gendou:         I give you an unfreedom.

Asuka:          Now that you have top and bottom.

Rei:            Now that you lost one degree of freedom.

Misato:         Now that you have to stand on the bottom.

Ryouji:         But you obtain a confort.

Makoto:         You get slightly easier in your mind.

Shigeru:        And you walk.

Maya:           That is your will.

Shinji:         Is this my will?

Ritsuko:        The world with the bottom is the world surrounding you.

Touji:          Yet, you can move freely.

Kensuke:        If you wish, you can change the position of the world.

Hikari:         The position of the world does not keep the same position.

Ryouji:         That changes through the time flow.

Fuyutsuki:      You can also change.

Gendou:         The things that forms you are your own mind and
                the world surrounding yourself.

Ritsuko:        Since this is your own world.

Misato:         The real figure that you conceive.

                        That is the reality.

Shinji:         This is the world with nothing, the space with nothing,
                the world with nothing.
                The world with nothing but me.
                I am getting  less understand myself.
                I feel as if I am going to disappear.
                My existence is fading away.

                        Why?

Misato:         Because there's nobody but you.

Shinji:         Nobody but me?

Misato:         Because you have no existence but of yourself,
                You can't figure out your own shape.

Shinji:         My shape?

                        My image.

Misato:         Yes. You are getting to know your own shape through
                seeing others' shape.

Asuka:          Seeing others' wall, you imagin yourself.

Rei:            You cannot see yourself unless there are others.

Shinji:         Because there are others, I can exist.
                If alone, I am always alone at anywhere.
                The world is entirely by my ..

Misato:         By cognizing the difference between you and others,
                you form the image of yourself.

Rei:            The very first other person is your mother.

Asuka:          Your mother is a different person from you.

Shinji:         Yes. I am I. Yet, it's true that others form the shape
                of my mind.

Misato:         That's right, Ikari Shinji-kun.

Asuka:          Too slow to understand.

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－

Asuka:          Stupid Shinji!
                You wake up now. Stupid Shinji!

Shinji:         Oh, it's you, Asuka?

Asuka:          You say "It's you Asuka?."
                Everymorning, I come to wake you up not to be late
                for school. Is that the word of gratitude to say to a 
                childhood friend?

Shinji:         Ah,, I mean thanx, so, let me sleep a little more.

Asuka:          What a lazy guy! Wake up! Wake up imediately.
                Oh! NO! You, mean stupid horny guy! Unbelievable!

Shinji:         It's morning. It's natural.

Yui:            Shinji is a lazy kid. He should be more grateful
                for Asuka who comes to wake him up.

Gendou:         hmm.

Yui:            You should stop reading newspaper.
                You must be ready.

Gendou:         hmmm.

Yui:            You are old enough, yet still like a kid like Shinji.

Gendou:         Are you ready?

Yui:            Yes. It's always me who is scolded by Teacher Fuyutsuki
                when you are late for the meeting.

Gendou:         Since you attract others.

Yui:            Stop saying stupid things. Change clothes!

Gendou:         hmmm, I see, Yui.

Asuka:          Hurry, Do it immediately!

Shinji:         OK, I know, You are too noisy.

Asuka:          What are you saying!

Asuka:          Now, I am off, Ma'am.

Shinji:         I am off.

Yui:            Bye! Good luck.
                Hey, how long are you reading?

Gendou:         hmmm, I see. Yui:

Shinji:         I hear that today we also have a new comer.

Asuka:          Well, yes. This city will be the new capitol city
                after the capitol transfer the next year.
                The population is increasing.

Shinji:         Right. What kinda girl? I hope a cute girl!

Asuka:          Oh, 

Rei:            Phew.. Late for school! It's very bad to be late for school
                from the very first day.

Shinji:         (breathing)

Rei:            Ouch!   Oh, sorry, I am truly hurrying.

Shinji:         Ouch,

Shinji:         Oh, 

Asuka:          gee.

Touji:          Really! Then you see that? I mean the girl's panty.

Shinji:         I did not intend to see but, only a moment,..

Touji:          WOW, What a lucky boy you are from the morning.
                Ouch! What are you doing ?

Hikari:         Suzuhara, don't talk such a  stupind things!
                Hey, replace water in the vase. You are on duty this week.

Touji:          What a noisy girl..

Hikari:         What did you say?

Shinji:         He will be controled [after he gets married], Touji will.

Asuka:          You will as well.

Shinji:         How come you say I will be controled?

Asuka:          YES. I told nothing but the truth.

Shinji:         Why?

Asuka:          You are what you appear to be.

Shinji:         Asuka, You are always speak ..

Kensuke:        Well, peaceful.

Touji:          Teacher Misato is coming!

Fool Torio:     WOWOWOW.

Misato:         Boys be glad! Today, I introduce you the transferee
                everybody is talking about.

Shinji:         WOW!

Rei:            You! You are that stupid guy that peeped my panty this morning.

Asuka:          NO, Stop! Don't say such a thing.
                It's you that showed to Shinji!

Rei:            You shit, why do you cover that guy?
                Does it mean, you two are the cop of tea?

Asuka:          Childhood friend. You shit!

Hikari:         Stop! It's school time. Be quiet!

Misato:         Well, You are enjoying. I am curious as well.
                Go ahead.

Students:       Laugh

－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－

Shinji:         I've got it. This is also a world.
                The possiblity within me.
                The me at the moment is not always the me as I am.
                There are many myselves.
                Yes. There must be the me who is not the Eva pilot.

Misato:         Thinking so, the real world itself is not always bad.

Shinji:         The real world might not always be bad.
                Yet, I hate myself. 

Makoto:         It's your mind that conceives that the reality is bad
                and hateful.

Shigeru:        The mind which confuses the reality with the truth.

Maya:           The view angle, the position. If these are slightly different,
                the things inside the mind will change a lot.

Ryouji:         The truthes are as many as people.

Kensuke:        But there's only one truth that you have,
                which is formed of the narrowed view of the world,
                That's revised information to protect yourself,
                the twisted truth.

Touji:          Oh, yes. the view of the world that one can
                have is quite small.

Hikari:         Yes, one measures things only by one's own small
                measure.

Asuka:          One see things with the truth given by others.

Misato:         Happy in the sunny day.

Rei:            Gloomy in the rainy day.

Asuka:          If taught so are you, you always think so.

Ritsuko:        Although You may enjoy rainy days.

Fuyutsuki:      Through the different way of conceiving, change into
                very different thing will the truth, the weak thing.

Ryouji:         The truth within a human is such cheap that
                people wish to know the more deep truth.

Gendou:         It's only that you are not used to be liked by people.

Misato:         So, you don't have to look upon other's face.

Shinji:         Yet, don't you hate me?

Asuka:          You idiot! It's you that is always trying to think so.

Shinji:         Yet, I hate myself.

Rei:            Those who hate oneselves cannot love or trust others.

Shinji:         I am wicked, coward, weak and ..

Misato:         If you know yourself, you can be kind to others.

Shinji:         I hate myself.
                But, I might be able to love myself.
                I might be allowed to stay here.
                Yes. I am nothing but I.
                I am I. I wish to be I.
                I wish to stay here as do I.
                I can stay here as do I!

People:         Congratulations!

Shinji:         Thank you!


                        Thank you, my father.
                        Good  bye, my mother.
                        And to the all children,
                        Congratulations!

            Gendou : I've been together with Adam already. There is only this way
                     so that I may meet Yui again, which is the fusion of Adam and
                     Lilith that was forbidden.

(Rei's left arm was wrenched off.)

            Gendou : There is no time any more. An A.T. field won't be able to
                     keep the shapes of yours. Well, let's begin, Rei. You're to
                     liberate the wall of the heart that is an A.T. field. Let's
                     complement of the missing heart, throw an unnecessary body
                     away and make our souls one now. Then, take me to the place
                     where Yui is here.

(Rei closes an eyes slowly. Gandou's right hand clutch Rei's breast, and creeps
 into her body. Gendou's right hand reached an abdomen under Rei's.)

             Seele : It's unavoidable though that number is small.

                     it become the figure of sincerity that brings the gospel to
                     humankind of us. Let's make the peoples become the figure
                     of sincerity by the grace that is equivalent to the death.
              Keel : There is even tranquility of the soul. Well, let's begin a
                     ceremony.


The sky of Tokyo-3.

(The production types throw Eva-02's remains which went in each mouth away.
 They stick a Spear of Longinus in Eva-01's palm. Then, they bite the wing of
 orange light which grew on the back of Eva-01. Eva-01 became crucifixion just

              Keel : For this time!

            Makoto : It turns over so that dimension measurement value may show
                     a minus! We can't be observe it. We can't make it numerical
                     value!
         Fuyutsuki : Is it anti-A.T. field?


The sky of Tokyo-3.

              Maya : All phenomena resemble a happening 15 years ago closely...
                     Well, is this also the sign of the 3rd impact??


JSSDF, frontline base in Tokyo-3.
---------------------------------
(A member of JSSDF looks up at the Tree of Sephiroth that is floated in the sky.)

 A member of JSSDF : The SS engine met criticalness!
 A member of JSSDF : We stop operations. Each force is to withdraw promptly.
 A member of JSSDF : Gravitation between the molecule can't be maintained any further.

(Tremendous light swallows the surface of the earth of Geo-Front.)


Nerv, 2nd announcement place.

(Each screen are controlled in the noise.)

           Shigeru : It was a direct hit! The the earth's surface of accumulation
                     layer fused!
            Makoto : The 2nd wave is digging the circumference of the headquarters!
                     The part of The part of the outside shell is disclosed!!
         Fuyutsuki : It's a physical shock wave yet. We'll be able to stand it
                     if we make an absorber the biggest.

(Tremendous light spreads out like an eye around the Geo-Front.)


The room of Seele.
------------------
             Seele : It shows the time of the eternity...
             Seele : By means of a purification ceremony of the red soil...
             Seele : Geo-Front for starters...
              Keel : Let's make that the figure of sincerity.

(The circumference of Tokyo-2 was dug on a large scale. Geo-Front becomes a
 black ball body, and that is raised.)


Nerv, 2nd announcement place.
-----------------------------
         Fuyutuski : Lilith's egg or the black moon which is enough for the
                     source of humankind's life. We don't hope that we're
                     returned into the shell after such a long time. However,
                     they're depend on Lilith...


The Heaven's door in Terminal Dogma.
------------------------------------
            Gendou : It seems that a thing began. Well, Rei. Take me to the place
                     where Yui is here.

(Rei stares at Gendou.)

            Gendou : That can't be true!?
               Rei : I'm not your doll.

(Rei takes Gendou's right arm in her body. Gendou steps back from Rei with
 tottering step.)

            Gendou : Why!?

(Rei's left hand regenerates quickly.)

               Rei : I can't be yours.

(Rei flies to the air toward Lilith.)

            Gendou : Hey, Rei! Please wait!! Rei!
               Rei : No, Ikari-kun is calling me.
            Gendou : Rei!

(Rei stands before Lilith's breast.)

               Rei : I'm home.
           A telop : "Hello, dear."

(Lilith's breast upheaves to take Rei in the body. Rei is taken in Lilith.
 Lilith separates the both hands that it was crucified from the red cross,
 and it collapses simply to L.C.L. The body that it go fat become tense,
 and changes to the flexible woman's body. The mask of Seele which covered
 Lilith's face comes off a white thread. Lilith's face becomes that of Rei's
 which an eye is not in.)

                     "pattern blue"
              Maya : What a angels!?
           Shigeru : No, it's wrong!
            Makoto : It's a person, or a human!

(Giant Lilith passes through the 2nd announcement place. Also, Lilith's left hand
 so in Maya and body as well.)

              Maya : !!!!!! ( shriek.)


The sky of Tokyo-3.
-------------------
            Shinji : Damn it, hang it, blast it!!

(Giant Lilith's body becomes more huge so that it may reach the sky where
 Eva-01 is here. There is no eyes in Lilith's face, instead a dark hollow.
 Lilith holds out both hands to wrap Eva-01. Shinji is cramped in the imminent
 sight by fear.)

            Shinji : Ayanami!? Rei!?
            Lilith : !!

(In the moment, the red eyes like that Rei has is born instead of a dark hollow.)

            Shinji : (A scream.)

            Makoto : They amplify further!
         Fuyutsuki : Did they begin assimilation with Rei?


The sky of Tokyo-3.
-------------------
(Rei's face of the various size appears from the production types' mouth.)

              Rei : He he.
           Shinji : !!
              Rei : He he he...
           Shinji : !!!

(Shinji crazy keeps moving a lever in the cockpit.)

           Shinji : (A scream.)


Nerv, 2nd announcement place.
-----------------------------
          Shigeru : The signal of his mentality graph declines.
           Makoto : His distordo is physicalization!
        Fuyutsuki : Pilot's self won't be able to stand up to it any further...


The inside Eva-01.
------------------
           Shinji : I can't bear this any more, I can't bear this any more.
                    I can't bear this any more, I can't bear this any more...

(Naked giant Kaworu separates from Lilith's waist.)

           Kaworu : Had you already done enough?

(Kaworu holds out both hands to wrap Eva-01.)

           Shinji : Were you there, Kaworu-kun?

(Shinji's expression is becomes rapture sloppy.)


Nerv, 2nd announcement place.
-----------------------------
          Shigeru : His solenoid graph turned over. His self-boundary weakens.
           Makoto : The pattern of A.T. fields changes from blue to red!


The sky of Tokyo-3.
-------------------
(The tip of Spear of Longinus touches a core in Eva-01's breast, and they unify
 it. Eva-01 becames a huge cross with red tree. An innumerable little eye is born
 from everywhere in Eva-01's body.)


Nerv, 2nd announcement place.
-----------------------------
         Fuyutsuki : The nut of the life which angels has, and the nut of the
                     wisdom which a person has. Eva-01 got both things, which
                     her existence became equal to God. Then, she's reduced to
                     the tree which is enough for the large river of the life.
                     When the 3rd impact happened, our future was entrusted to
                     Ikari's son whether it become the ark which saves a person
                     from nothing or it become the devil who ruined a person.
              Maya : Hey!? Is it right we have gone!?
           Shigeru : It cannot be understood!


The sky of Tokyo-3.
-------------------
               Yui : Present Rei is your own heart. It's your wish that itself.
               Rei : What do you wish for?

(The surface of the water wavers that is actual film by the CG composition.)


A complement by Shinji.
-----------------------
(In the evening park, Lighting for the photography is shining. Back ground music
 is "Musunde hiraite" which a Japanese children's song. Little Shinji is playing
 in the sandbox in the center of the park. An image is very rough.)

            Shinji : It's so! It's the same as when I begin a cello. When I come
                     here, I thought that something would be here.
              Girl : Shinji-kun will do it too!
              Girl : Keep up a complete a castle!
     Little Shinji : Yeah!

(Little Shinji creates a castle of the sand with girls who are 2 bodies of dolls.)

              Girl : Oh, my mum!
              Girl : I'll have to come back to my house.
              Girl : Good bye!!
              Girl : Maaaaauuuuuhhhhhmmmmmm!

(A deep groove between tha next stage where 2 girls' mother is sitting on the
 simple chair and the stage where Shinji is here. It gets dark, which song of the
 crow can be heard. Give up though Little Shinji tries to go to the next stage.
 Little Shinji begins to create a castle in the sandbox again. The tempo of BGM
 becomes fast like a crazy. Little Shinji completes the pyramid just like a
 headquarters of Nerv, and staring at it, and kicks it. Little Shinji demolishes
 the castle of sand. Although, little Shinji creates a castle alone again.)


(In the some place, Shinji holds an Asuka each other by nakedness.)

             Asuka : Oh, no!! I'm irritated that I'm viewing you!!
            Shinji : So I seem to be you?
      Little Asuka : Mu... mum...
             Asuka : Mu... mum...
            Shinji : Mum...
            Misato : I couldn't become Shinji-kun's mother after all...

(Shinji is staring at the pendant of the cross given to it by Misato.)


(In the apartment where Misato and Kaji were university students lived in.)

      Young Misato : Let me see... Let's do it...
        Young Kaji : Is it again? Do you meet your friend today at school?
      Young Misato : Ah, that's Ritsuko. It doesn't care because I still have
                     time.
        Young Kaji : One week had already passed after sloppy life was begun
                     here.
      Young Misato : I've been able to take a knack gradually. Because let's
                     do it...

(Misato's gasping voice. Shinji is looking at their sexual intercourse.)

            Misato : Maybe, I do this thing so that I may confirm that I'm
                     here.
             Asuka : It's an silly!! Lonely adults must comfort each other!
           Ritsuko : You can think that a stranger needs even your body, didn't
                     you?
            Misato : I'm happy because I feels a stranger needs myself.
             Asuka : You can thought that I may have value easily in that case!
            Shinji : Is.. is Misato-san doing such a thing?
            Misato : It's so. This is I too. The hearts that each other melt
                     reflects m1e whom Shinji-kun doesn't know. Pain is too
                     entailed in the truth but you must stand it.
             Asuka : Do I do a thing like Misato if I grow up?


(In the condominium where Shinji lives with Misato and Asuka.)

             Asuka : Shall we kiss, Shinji?
            Misato : No, always!
            Asuaka : Or, is it scared?
            Misato : Children don't usually do it.
             Asuka : Well, let's do it.

(Asuka kicks Shinji.)

             Asuka : You aren't to come by me though you don't know my thing!
            Shinji : I'll know you.
             Asuka : You don't know it! Do you have a nonsence!? Will you know
                     my thing? Can you think that you save me? You must get
                     stuck-up about arrogance. You must not know me!
            Shinji : I cannot know your thing. Because Asuka says nothing to me.
                     It's impossible to say that you wants me to knows your
                     thing. You tell nothing to me though!!


(The inside old-train.)

               Rei : Did Ikari-kun try to know it?
            Shinji : I willed to know it.
             Asuka : What a you're a fool! I knew that you were making me to an
                     imaginary bedmate... Show me the masturbation as usual...
                     Hey, I'm watching it.

(Asuka coerces Shinji.)

             Asuka : If you don't become mine, I don't want what either.
            Shinji : Therefore, will you be kind to me?
             Asuka : I'll be kind to you.
               Rei : I'll be kind to you.
            Misato : I'll be kind to you.

(Asuka and Misato and Rei rise one after another by nakedness.)

            Shinji : It's a lie!! They must be deceived by the face laughed at
                     me! They must want to make it vague!!
               Rei : So truth hurts anyone. It's very very severe.
            Shinji : A vague thing only corners me...
               Rei : It's an evasive answer.
            Shinji : I'm scared at it just like this. Anyone mayn't needs me
                     someday! I get flustered, I'm not calm, tell me a voice!
                     Keep me mate! Anyone cares about me!!

(Shinji turns around slowly. However, Asuka and Rei and Misato doesn't do an
 answer to Shinji.)


(In the condominium where Shinji lives with Misato and Asuka. Asuka puts a face
 to sleep on the table in the kitchen.)

            Shinji : I want to be useful for you. I want to be here much together
                     with you.
             Asuka : Therefore, you're to do nothing. You must not to come by me
                     any more. Because you only hurt me...
            Shinji : Hey, Asuka, help me. Hey, one must be Asuka so that I may be
                     saved, will you?

(Asuka stares at Shinji.)

             Asuka : You've a lie.
            Shinji : !!

(Asuka stands up and approaches Shinji.)

             Asuka : You don't care even whoever a companion is. Because you're
                     scared at both Misato and first children, and both your
                     father and your mother!! You're simply run away to me!
            Shinji : Help me.
             Asuka : Because, it's a easiest, so you aren't damaged.
            Shinji : Please, help.. me...
             Asuka : You've never come to love a stranger really!!!
            Shinji : !

(Shinji is pushed away by Asuka, and he collapses on the floor with the coffee
 manufacturer.)

             Asuka : Only you're here! You've never felt to love a even yourself
                     too!!!!

(Hot coffee spills to the shirt that Shinji wears. Asuka despises Shinji.)

             Asuka : You're pitiful...

(Shinji stands up slowly.)

            Shinji : Help, hey, help me. Let you help me, anyone helps me. Help,
                     help!!!!!!!

(Shinji overturns a table.)

            Shinji : Help me!!!!!

(Shinji swings a chair.)

            Shinji : Don't leave me alone!! Don't desert me!! Don't kill me!!

(The chair which Shinji threw rolls in Asuka's foot. Shinji is out of breath.)

             Asuka : ..................................................No.

(Asuka spit out at Shinji.)

            Shinji : !

(After time passed for a while, Shinji begins to wring Asuka's neck with becoming
 a look of a murderer. Back ground music become "Komm, susser Tod 'The
 honeyed death is to come.'" from this time.)

               Rei : No one knows your thing.
            Shinji : I thought that there was the world which never wavered
                     and not to be unpleasant in.
               Rei : You solely believed that a stranger and yourself are the
                     same.
            Shinji : You betrayed me! You betrayed my hoping!!
               Rei : It's your misunderstanding from the beginning. You only
                     freely believed that too much though.
            Shinji : Anyone doesn't surely need me. Therefore, anyone is to dies.
               Rei : Well, what's there a your hand for?
            Shinji : Anyone is the same even though I'm here or not. Nothing
                     changes. Therefore, anyone is to dies.
               Rei : Well, what's there a your heart for?
            Shinji : I'd better not rather be here. Therefore, I'm to die too.
               Rei : Well, why are you here?

(Shinji is sleeping on his back, Rei is straddles on Shinji by nakedness. Their
 sex organs are combined. Rei is taking a hand into Shinji's breast. It's that
 a heart and a body are one.)

            Shinji : Hmmm... Ayanami.....? Where is this?
               Rei : This is the sea of L.C.L. This is in the sea of the source
                     of the life. The world which we who lost an A.T. field so
                     that lost one's shape are in. The vague world which one
                     doesn't know one's and stranger's boundary. The frail world
                     which one is anywhere, and one is not where
            Shinji : Did I die?
               Rei : No, anybody becames only one. This is the world which you
                     hoped by all means for.
            Shinji : But...this is wrong. I thought this is wrong.
               Rei : If you hope for the stranger's existence, the wall of the
                     heart will be draw all people apart once more, which your
                     stranger's fear begins again.
            Shinji : It's still okay with me...

(Shinji pulls out Rei's right hand from his heart, and shake hands.)

            Shinji : Thank you.


The sea of pale-blue liquid.
----------------------------
(Shinji went to sleep with a head on Rei's lap by nakedness.)

            Shinji : I felt that there was only unpleasant. Therefore, I was
                     allowed to run away from there certainly. However, there
                     was not pleasant in the place where I ran away. Because
                     I'm not there, it's the same as no one is here.
            Kaworu : Don't you care even though an A.T. field hurts you and
                     your stranger again.

(Kaworu who put on his student uniform appears.)

            Shinji : Yes. However, what are you who are in my heart?

(They who put on their student uniform are standing on the field.)

               Rei : We are "hope", which they may understand each other.

(The people who dissolved in L.C.L. appear on the field one after another.)

            Kaworu : With the word of "like"

(A field changes to the asphaltic road.)

            Shinji : But, it's the thing that make-believes. It's that I believed
                     freely. It's the thing like a grace. They cannot last all
                     the time. They'll betray me someday. They'll desert me...

            Kaworu : There is reality in the place where you don't know. There
                     is a dream in the reality.
               Rei : Then, there is truth in the heart.
            Kaworu : So, a person's heart is creating person's shape.
               Rei : And, the new image will changes the shapes of the heart and
                     person. The images creates the power to create, person's
                     future, and the flow of the times.

(Lilith's neck and right arm fall into the earth.)

            Kaworu : But, you must move by your will so that you may change.
               Rei : Therefore, take it back with your power if losing sight of

               Yui : There is no anxiety. All life has the power that tries to be
                     restored, and the heart that tries to be lives. Anywhere
                     becomes heaven whether one thinks that tries to be live,
                     because one is living. The chance which can become happy is
                     anywhere.

(Eva-01 folds the 12 sheetes of wings, and suspends activities.)

               Yui : It's all right so far as there're a sun and moon and earth.


The sea of L.C.L.
-----------------
(Yui who put on her white coat stands opposite to Shinji who put on his student
 uniform, and floats in the sea of L.C.L. The background of Shinji is the earth.)

               Yui : Have you already been right?

(Yui touches the Shinji's cheeks.)

            Shinji : I don't know where my happiness is yet. However, I'm here,
                     I'll keep thinking about the meaning that I'm born here from
                     this as well. But, I must notice that they' re natural things
                     many times. To I'm here by myself...

(Shinji appears on the surface of red sea which Lilith's face fractures into 2 is
 appearing on. Yui goes down into the sea.)

            Shinji : However, what did mum to do?


In 2003 A.D, Ashi-no Lake.
---------------------------
         Fuyutsuki : Is your sincerity of purpose to person is creationan Eva
                     in imitation of God?
               Yui : Yes. A person can live in only this star. But, Eva can live
                     infinity everywhere together with the person's hearts that
                     resides in it. When 50 hundred million years have passed,
                     though it can be left even if the earth and the moon and even
                     the sun are vanished. I wish that I live even only one person
                     though it's very lonely...
         Fuyutsuki : Do you want to say that the evidence that a person lived is
                     left eternally?


The cosmos.
------------
(Eva-01 and Spear of Longinus go away to universal far.)

            Shinji : Good-bye, my mum.


-----------------------------
THE END OF
E V A N G E L I O N
ONE MORE FINAL:

                  I need you.
-----------------------------


The earth.
----------
(Lilith's blood floats in a black-and-blue sky. The sea dyes red. The pendant
 of the cross given to Shinji by Misato was driven into the headstone. The
 production types who became a stone turned to stick in the beach. Shinji who
 put on his student uniform and Asuka who put on her plug-suit are sleeping on
 one's back in the seashore. Asuka is dressing her right arm, and wearing an
 eye-patch in the left eye. Shinji sees the seaside with sleeping. Rei who put
 on her student uniform is standing there, it disappears soon. Shinji straddles
 Asuka, and getting wrings Asuka's neck. Shinji puts the power to wrings. Asuka
 doesn't take act with her right eye opened. Asuka touches Shinji's cheeks with
 turn the right eye away from Shinji. Shinji stops little by little wringing
 Asuka's neck.)

            Shinji : (Groaning.)

(Shinji cries with sobs. The tears that Shinji shed fall in drops into Asuka's
 cheeks.)

            Shinji : (Groaning.)

(Asuka stares at Shinji without an expression.)

             Asuka : I feel sick...



(THE END.)

Asuka:          That I will disappear.

Shinji:         Yet, I can disappear because I think I'm useless.

Rei:            Why?

Asuka:          Because I am useless.

Shinji:         After all, I am a useless child.
                Nobody cares about me.

Misato:        Thinking nobody cares about you is the same
                as running away.
                You fear failure.
                You fear being disliked.
                You fear seeing the weakness within you.

Shinji:         You too!

Misato:         Right. We are the same.

Ritsuko:        Our minds lack something.

Asuka:          So we fear that.

Rei:            So we worry about that

Misato:         So we are trying to be one.

Asuka:          We are trying to compliment
                by the instrumentality of each other.

Rei:            That's the Instrumentality Project.

Fuyutsuki:      One cannot live without being surrounded by others.

Gendou:         One cannot live alone.

Ritsuko:        One is always unique.

Ryouji:         So, it's hard.

Asuka:          So, it's sad.

Misato:         So, one wishes to feel others' minds and bodies.

Rei:            So we wish to be one.

Fuyutsuki:      A human is made of weak and fragile materials.

Ritsuko:        The mind and body are also made of weak and fragile materials.

Gendou:         So it is necessary to compliment
                by the instrumentality of each other.

                        Why?

Gendou:         There's no other way to live.

                        Is that true?

Rei:            Why do you live?

                        I've no idea.

Asuka:          I might live to know why.

Rei:            For whom do you live?

Asuka:          For myself, of course.

Shinji:         Probably for myself.

                        Is that true?

Rei:            Do you enjoy your life?

Shinji:         I wonder.

Rei:            Do you enjoy your life?

Asuka:          Of course yes.

Rei:            Do you enjoy your life?

Misato:         I don't want to do anything not enjoyable.

Ryouji:         You hate being sad?

Shinji:         I don't like it.

Ryouji:         You hate hardships?

Misato:         I don't like them.

Ryouji:         So you run away.

Misato:         Yes. Do you blame me, for running away from something
                I hate.

Shinji:         I can't run away.

Rei:            Why don't you run away?

Shinji:         If I ran away, it would be more painful.

Rei:            You ran away from something painful.

Shinji:         It was painful.

Asuka:          If you know the pain, then everything's OK.

Misato:         You can run away if it's painful.

Rei:            You can run away from something you truly hate.

Shinji:         But, I won't. I don't want to run away.
                No. I shall not run away.

Misato:         It's because you already know that running away results
                in more pain.

Asuka:          You know how painful it is to run away.

Rei:            So you don't want to run away.

Shinji:         I said, if I ran away, nobody would care about me.
                Don't desert me! Please! Don't desert me!

Ritsuko:        Obeying others' words, that's his way to live.

Shinji:         Right! Otherwise, I would be deserted.

Asuka:          You fear being hurt.

Misato:         You are trying to believe that.

Kensuke:        Not only you but also others are hurt.

Touji:          Everybody feels hardships.

Hikari:         You think that, because it's easier for you.

Shinji:         Shut up! That's nothing to do with me.
                People don't care about me.

Misato:         And you always desert your worth.

Rei:            I have nothing.

Asuka:          And you try to think yourself valueless.

Misato:         Thinking that, by doing nothing, you would not be hurt.

Asuka:          People try to sustain themselves by being praised.

Shinji:         NOBODY ACCEPTS ME.

Misato:         You are trying to think that.

Shinji:         So, I have to pilot Eva.

Misato:         You've been trying to think yourself worthless since the
                very beginning.

Shinji:         I have to do that.

Kensuke:        No, that's not so.

Touji:          You are trying to think that, anyway.

Shinji:         I am worthless. I have nothing to be proud of.

Asuka:          So you pilot Eva.

Shinji:         Piloting Eva lets me be myself.

Asuka:          Piloting Eva lets me be myself.

Shinji:         Before piloting Eva, I had nothing.
                The fact that I pilot Eva lets me stay here.

Asuka:          I have nothing else.

Rei:            I have nothing else.

Shinji:         I have nothing. NOTHING.

                        The value to live?

Shinji:         No don't I have it. I hate myself.

                        THUS,

Asuka:          I hate you! I hate you!

Touji:          Ah hate you.

Kensuke:        I hate everything about you.

Hikari:         Sorry, but I hate you.

Ritsuko:        I hate you.

Makoto:         I hate you.

Shigeru:        I hate you.

Maya:           I hate everything about you.

Ryouji:         I hate everything about you.

Misato:         I hate you!

Shinji:         Now, everybody hates me.
                Probably, people hate me.

Rei:            You are just trying to think that.

Shinji:         NO. Because I hate myself.

Rei:            So, you are trying to think that others hate you.

Asuka:          I hate, I hate I hate you!

Shinji:         But, I am praised.
                I am praised when I pilot Eva.
                I was praised.

                        So, you were happy.

Shinji:         I was praised by people!

                        But, not happy.

Rei:            Which is your true heart?

Shinji:         I don't know, or, both of them are my true hearts.

Misato:         So you pilot Eva.

Shinji:         I have nothing but Eva.

Rei:            Otherwise you cannot keep yourself?

Misato:         It's true that Eva Unit One is part of your mind.

Ritsuko:        If you depend on Eva too much,
                Eva itself will be you.

Ryouji:         Eva will be all of yourself.

Misato:         The true yourself will be nowhere.

Shinji:         It's OK. I've had nothing from the beginning.
                I've been learning cello, but it didn't go anywhere.

Asuka:          I didn't try to do it from your side.

Shinji:         But, now that I can pilot Eva.

Asuka:          And, when you lost Eva, you couldn't do anything, like me.

                        Why do you pilot Eva?

Shinji:         Because it's all of me.

                 NEON GENESIS EVANGELION
                             FINALE Take care of yourself
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shinji:         Rain, gloomy mood, just like my mood. I don't like that.

Rei:            The sinking sun, fading life, my wish. I don't like that.

Asuka:          Morning, the beginning of today, the beginning of
                a bad day. I don't like that.

Shinji:         Blue sky. Something warm, something unfamiliar,
                something horrible. something useless. I don't like that.

Asuka:          I hate everybody!

Misato:         What do you want?

                        Do you hate anxiety?

Asuka:          What do you need?

                        Do you hate peace?

Rei:            What do you want?

                        Don't hate me!

Asuka:          Don't hate me!

Shinji:         What I fear is,

                        Rejection

Rei:            What I need is,

                        Contact and Approval

Shinji:         May I stay with you?

Rei:            May I stay here?

Asuka:          Do you love me?

                        Your Mother,

                        Do you love her?

Asuka:          You wanna go to where your mom is?

Asuka:          No, I don't.

Shinji:         Don't you wanna go your to your dad's?

Shinji:         No, I don't.

Rei:            Why not?

                        Because I fear.

Shinji:         I fear to be hated.

Asuka:          Because I would disappear.

                        So what?

Misato:         What do you want?

                        Erasing anxiety.

Rei:            What do you need?

                        Erasing sadness.

Yui:            You are not happy, are you?

Shinji:         Before that, I need. I need my worth.
                In order to be appreciated, in order not to be
                deserted,

                        I need my own WORTH.

Yui:            That is what you must admit to yourself.
                You must admit your own value.

                        So you pilot Eva.

Shinji:         I don't have any value.

Asuka:          I don't have value worth living for.

Rei:            Then, what are you?

Shinji:         Then what am I?

                        Where am I?

Shinji:         What the hell am I?

                        So, you need the barrier of the mind.

Shinji:         What? It's me. The shape that I show to others,
                the symbol representing me.
                This, and this, and this, all these are representations
                of me. Nothing but the things that make others recognize me.
                What am I? Is this me? The true me? The false me?

Rei:            You are you. Yet, you have your own region and border.

Shinji:         Let's see. My clothes, my shoes, my room.
                Those are part of myself.

Rei:            The things linked together by your will.

Shinji:         The thing that I think is myself is me.
                I am nothing but myself.
                Yet, I don't understand. Where am I?
                What am I? What am I?
                Nobody understands me.

                         And so, you wished for a
                         barrier around your heart

Asuka:          You idiot! Of course not!
                Nobody ever understands you.

Misato:         The one who takes care of you, and the one
                who understands you, is nobody but yourself.

Rei:            So, take care of yourself.

Shinji:         But I still don't have myself, so I don't understand myself.
                There's no way to take care of myself.

                        You are unstable.

Rei:            You are still unstable.

Misato:         The present you,

Asuka:          The people around the present you,

Rei:            The environment that surrounds the present you.

Misato:         None of them last forever.

Asuka:          Your time is always flowing.

Rei:            You are made of the changing world.
                You are the thing that may change according to
                your own mind.

Shinji:         What? The world of nothing. The world with nobody.

Shinji:         The world of freedom.

Shinji:         Freedom?

Shinji:         The world of freedom which will never be restrained by
                 anybody.

Shinji:         Is this Freedom?

Shinji:         Yes. The world of freedom.

Rei:            As a result, there's nothing.

Shinji:         Unless I think.

Misato:         Yes, unless you think.

Shinji:         What the hell! I don't know what I should do.

Rei:            You are uneasy.

Asuka:          You don't have your own image.

Shinji:         Too vague.

Misato:         Everything is vague.

                        That's freedom.

Ryouji:         The world where you can do anything you like.

Misato:         Yet, you are uneasy.

Fuyutsuki:      Don't you know what you should do?

Shinji:         What should I do?

Gendou:         I give you a constraint.

Asuka:          Now you have a top and a bottom.

Rei:            Now you have lost one degree of freedom.

Misato:         Now you have to stand on the ground.

Ryouji:         But you obtain a comfort.

Makoto:         Your mind becomes slightly easier.

Shigeru:        And you walk.

Maya:           That is your will.

Shinji:         Is this my will?

Ritsuko:        The world with a floor is the world surrounding you.

Touji:          Yet, you can move freely.

Kensuke:        If you wish, you can change the position of the world.

Hikari:         The position of the world does not stay the same.

Ryouji:         It changes through the flow of time.

Fuyutsuki:      You can also change.

Gendou:         The things that form you are your own mind and
                the world surrounding you.

Ritsuko:        Since this is your own world.

Misato:         The real form that you conceive.

                        That is reality.

Shinji:         This is the world of nothing, space with nothing,
                the world of nothing.
                The world with nothing but me.
                I am understanding myself less.
                I feel as if I'm going to disappear.
                My existence is fading away.

                        Why?

Misato:         Because there's nobody but you.

Shinji:         Nobody but me?

Misato:         Because you have no existence outside of yourself,
                You can't figure out your own shape.

Shinji:         My shape?

                        My image.

Misato:         Yes. You are getting to know your own shape through
                seeing others' shapes.

Asuka:          Seeing others' walls, you imagine yourself.

Rei:            You cannot see yourself unless there are others.

Shinji:         Because there are others, I can exist.
                If alone, I am always alone anywhere.
                The world is entirely from me..

Misato:         By recognizing the difference between yourself and
                others, you form an image of yourself.

Rei:            The very first other person is your mother.

Asuka:          Your mother is a different person from you.

Shinji:         Yes. I am I. Yet, it's true that others form the shape
                of my mind.

Misato:         That's right, Ikari Shinji-kun.

Asuka:          You're too slow to understand.

Asuka:          Stupid Shinji!
                Wake up now, Stupid Shinji!

Shinji:         Oh, it's you, Asuka?

Asuka:          All you say is, "It's you Asuka?"
                Every morning, I come to wake you up so you won't be late
                for school. Are those the words of gratitude to say to a
                childhood friend?

Shinji:         Ah, I mean thanks, so, let me sleep a little more...

Asuka:          What a lazy guy! Wake up! Wake up right now!
                Oh! NO! You, mean stupid horny guy! Unbelievable!

Shinji:         It's morning, I can't help it.

Yui:            Shinji is a lazy kid. He should be more grateful
                for Asuka, who comes to wake him up.

Gendou:         hmm.

Yui:            Stop reading newspaper, dear!
                You have to get ready.

Gendou:         hmmm.

Yui:            You're older, but you're still a kid like Shinji.

Gendou:         Are you ready?

Yui:            Yes. It's always me who is scolded by Dr. Fuyutsuki
                when you're late for a meeting.

Gendou:         Since you attract others.

Yui:            Stop saying stupid things. Change your clothes!

Gendou:         hmmm, alright, Yui.

Asuka:          Hurry, Do it now!

Shinji:         OK, I know, You're so noisy.

Asuka:          What was that?!

Asuka:          I'm off, Ma'am.

Shinji:         I'm off.

Yui:            Bye! Good luck.
                Dear, how long are you going to read?

Gendou:         hmmm, alright, Yui.

Shinji:         I hear that today we have a newcomer.

Asuka:          Well, yes. This city will be the new capitol city
                after the capitol transfer the next year.
                The population is increasing.

Shinji:         Right. What kinda girl? I hope she's cute!

Asuka:          Hmph!

Rei:            Phew.. Late for school! It's bad to be late for school
                the very first day!

Shinji:         (breathing)

Shinji:         Oh Ouch! Ouch!

Rei:            Ouch!   Oh, sorry, I'm really in a hurry.

Shinji:         Ouch,

Rei:            I'm very sorry.

Shinji:         Oh,

Asuka:          gee.

---------------------

Touji:          Really! Then you see it? I mean the girl's panties.

Shinji:         I didn't mean to look, but, only a little...

Touji:          WOW, What a lucky boy you are so early in the morning.
                Ouch! What are you doing ?

Hikari:         Suzuhara, don't say such stupid things!
                Here, replace the water in the vase. You're on duty this week.

Touji:          What an annoying girl...

Hikari:         What did you say?

Shinji:         Touji is gonna be whipped.

Asuka:          You will too.

Shinji:         How come you're saying I'll be whipped?

Asuka:          Well, I said nothing but the truth.

Shinji:         Why?

Asuka:          You are what you appear to be.

Shinji:         Asuka, You're always talking ..

Kensuke:        It's so peaceful.

Touji:          Misato-sensei is coming!

Fool Trio:     WOWOWOW.

Touji:          Misato-sensei is great.

Hikari,Asuka:   That trio of fools, They are truly stupid.

Hikari:         Stand up. Bow. Sit down.

Misato:         Rejoice, boys! Today, I introduce the transferee
                everybody is talking about.

Rei:            I am Ayanami Rei. Nice to meet you!

Shinji:         WOW!

Rei:            You! You are that stupid guy that peeped at my
                   panties this morning.

Asuka:         Stop it! Don't say such a thing.
                You're the one who showed Shinji!

Rei:            You shit, why are you covering for that guy?
                Does that mean you two are a couple?

Asuka:          Childhood friend, you bitch!

Hikari:         Stop! It's time for school. Be quiet!

Misato:         Well, You're having fun. I am curious too.
                Continue.

Students:       Laugh

Shinji:         I've got it. This is also a world.
                The possibility within me.
                The me at the moment is not always the me as I am.
                There are many of myself.
                Yes. There must be a me who is not an Eva pilot.

Misato:    Considering that, the real world itself is not always bad.

Shinji:         The real world might not always be bad.
                But, I hate myself.

Makoto:         It's your mind that conceives that the reality is bad
                and hateful.

Shigeru:        The mind which confuses Reality with the Truth.

Maya:           The angle of view, the position. If these are slightly
                 different, what is inside your mind will change a lot.

Ryouji:         There are as many truths as there are people.

Kensuke:        But there's only one truth that you have,
                which is formed from your narrow view of the world,
                It is revised information to protect yourself,
                the twisted truth.

Touji:          Oh, yes. the view of the world that one can
                have is quite small.

Hikari:         Yes, you measure things only by your own small
                measure.

Asuka:          One sees things with the truth, given by others.

Misato:         Happy on a sunny day.

Rei:            Gloomy on a rainy day.

Asuka:          If you're taught that, you always think so.

Ritsuko:        But, you can enjoy rainy days.

Fuyutsuki:      Through different ways of conceiving, the truth
                will change into very different things; it's a weak thing.

Ryouji:         The truth within a person is such a cheap thing that
                people wish to know deeper truths.

Gendou:         It's only that you're not used to being liked by people.

Misato:         So, you don't have to look to others' faces.

Shinji:         But, don't you hate me?

Asuka:          You idiot! It's only you who is always trying to believe
                  that.

Shinji:         Yet, I hate myself.

Rei:            Those who hate themselves cannot love or trust others.

Shinji:         I am wicked, cowardly, weak and ..

Misato:         If you know yourself, you can be kind to others.

Shinji:         I hate myself.
                But, I might be able to love myself.
                I might be allowed to stay here.
                Yes. I am nothing but I.
                I am I. I wish to be I.
                I want to stay here!
                I can stay here!

People:         Congratulations!

Shinji:         Thank you!

                        Thank you, my father.
                        Good  bye, my mother.
                        And to the all the children,
                        Congratulations!
