Out of order ... I shouldn't have come ...
I may not be able to meet her. I can't help it. I'll go to the shelter.
Yes, but something is crunchy in my mouth.
Katsuragisan...
Misatosan...
I say, Misatosan...
Is it OK that you did such a thing...?
That doesn't seem like a very good excuse.
You think so ...
You are childish for your age, aren't you?
The special agency Nerv?
It's the one which my father belongs to.
I heard from the teacher that it's an important job for protecting the human race.
Are we going to where my father is?
Father ...
Here it is.
It's about my father's work... Are there anything for me to do?
I can't say I'm surprised. He can't write to me ... unless he wants me to do anything.
Ah, great! It's a real geofront!
We passed here some time ago.
Ah ... me too.
Uh,uh, it's pitch dark.
Ah, face ... A gigantic robot ...
Is it also Father's work?
Father ...
Why did you call me?
Do you mean that I should get into it and fight against the guy which I saw.
No way! What are you saying now?! I have been thinking that you didn't want me?!
Why me ...?
I can't do that. I've neither seen it nor heard it. Why are you saying that I can do it?
No. I can't. It's impossible.
No way. After coming all the way, it's ridiculous.
I understand. But, I don't think I can do that!
I'm unnecessary as I expected...
Watch out!
Don't run away, Don't run away, Don't run away, Don't run away, Don't run away ...... I'll do it. I'll get into it.
Hmm? What is this? Ah, ah, ah, Uguh......
Fuah, guhah... I feel sick.
Walking ...
Waliking ...
An unknown ceiling ......
I prefer to being alone. Any places are the same. 
What are you saying about?
Where are we going?
Somewhat ...... this is a lonesome city, isn't it?
Great! Buildings are growing!
I...I'm back. (TADAIMA)
Such a ...... a litte ......
Ice ......
Relishes ......
Only beers ...... What life does she lead?
Well, the refrigerator over there ......
Sleeping ...... ? 
Itadakimasu.
No, but ...... I'm not used to such a meal.
Ah ... no ... ah, I didn't mean that.
Ah...... yes.
Well. Because this is your house from today, you can really feel at home here.
A, a, yes.
Ah ... yes.
Wowowowowowowow! Mi, Mi, Mi, Misatosan!
Wha ...... Wha ...... What ...... What's tha......
Katsuragi Misatosan ...... She isn't a bad person.
In the bath, more unpleasant things come to my mind than others. 
This is an unknown ceiling, too. It's natural ... because I don't know any places in this city.
Why am I here? 
Waaaaaaah 
I've got used to it ...... I think I have nothing wrong.
Maybe ......
Switch ......
Aim at the target in the center, switch ... Aim at the target in the center, switch ... Aim at the target in the center, switch ... Aim at the target in the center, switch ... Aim at the target in the center ......
Misatosan, it's morning already.
Then, I ......
ITTEKIMASU.
Ah, uh, I must keep such a things secret ......
I'm not sure, but they called it Eva or Unit One ......
It's some knife and the vibrations ...... like ultrasonic wave ......
Speaking of myself, I'm not doing that by choice.
Although my father is not here, whay am I still pilotting it.
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run away ......
Uhaaaaaaaaah!
Uhaaaaaaaaah!
Until today, three days have already passed ......
I must go back.
I'm sorry.
I know well, of course. That's enough, isn't that? We won anyway.
I don't mind if so.
That isn't the question. Anyhow, it's only me that can get into it. I'll do.
Misato said that the ecosystems are returning to their former states.
You'd not better do it. I think your mother would be worried about it.
Do you usually do like that?
Is that a training for a guerrilla warfare?
Yes. * Shinji goes with them. Kensuke is left alone there.
I don't know.
You don't scold me, don't you? It's natural because you are no relation to me.
If I tell you that I don't want to get into Unit One, how will you do with it?
It seems unrealistic that you force all off on her.
Don't worry. I'll get into it.
That's natural. First of all, I'm not cut out for that.
But Ayanami, Misatosan and Ritsukosan
Where is Misato san? I'd like to say good bye.
Well, could I bother you for a second? Er rrr, thank you.
I can't do that.
But ......
Only one, then.
How did you know this?
It's me that have to be hit. I'm mean, cowardly, dishonest and a weakling ...... A man of
Ayanami...
Oh, sorry! I've been apologizing a lot since yesterday...
I don't want to eat.
Do I really have to get into Eva again?
Your words can be so cold because you've never experienced horrible things in it. I never want to experience such things again...
Ritsukosan is...?
This was not meant for field battle. Will it really work?
Will everything be okay?
But I've never practiced!
And if I miss and the enemy shoots at us?
We're in a tight pinch...
We may die...
Why are you doing this?
Bonds to my father?
You are strong, Ayanami.
You have nothing else...? ~twi
Ayanami, are you all right? Ayanami! Don't say "I have nothing else." Don't say "good bye" when we launchit's too sad.
I think you should smile...
Good... morning.
No coffee?
Misatosan's tradition, anyway...
Remember who's on duty for breakfast this morning?
Now I know why at your age you're still single.
And you're lazy, aren't you?
I'm finished. Are you really coming to school today?
But you're so busy...
Responsibility?
Don't meet them looking like that. It's shameful.
I don't think so.
I don't think so...
Touji and the guys don't know her coarse manners...
You would have a hard time...
The Earth and peace. I use Eva for the sake of those. What's Eva? An entry plug which smells of blood and somehow calms me. Nothing. Nothing I know.
So, you're saying the Second Impact that vapourized Antarctica was...
Then, the things we're doing are...
Good morning.
Well... okay.
You're riding on that, Misatosan?
That's ridiculous!
It's too dangerous!
I don't mean that! I mean Misatosan's....
I've caught up!
Misatosan, take care! 
Stop! Stop! this guy!
Misatosan, hurry!
Misatosan, escape!
MISATOSAN!
Misatosan, are you all right? Misatosan?
I'm glad! You are alive! I'm glad to hear that! You're great! You're so wonderful! A miracle happened!
G'morning! I'm off!
I thought so, but she's lazy, coarse, bad looking, and anything but nice at home. It's shameful for me to see her.
So, where are we headed?
The ship is huge!
She looks like Ritsukosan...
Um, yes. Ah, how do you know my name?
I got lucky.
He seems to be rather lively... Kajisan, I mean.
Hmm, Unit Two is red. I didn't expect that.
Ah, what's happening?
What's that...?! Is that... an Angel?
What do I do? I've got to get back to Misatosan.
Hey, where are we going?
What's she doing...?
Hey, why are we changing into plug suits?
That's going too far. What about Misatosan's permission?
An error? What happened?
What do you mean?
All right... Ba baumkuuhen...
If this falls into the sea, it's over.
We're coming!
That direction! Only 58 seconds left.
It's coming from 9 o'clock!
But we have no firearms.
The thing's damn big!
We must deal with it.
It's coming again!
With Bequipment...
What can we do?!
Here it comes!
'Cause it's an _Angel_...
Well, we're in another tight spot.
But we have to free ourselves!
I'll do my best.
But if we can't open the mouth soon, we'll be destroyed, too.
Guu... guuten morugenn.
Oh, Ayanami is..
No way. That's the operation.
Oh, coming!
Oh, I support you?
dumn it! New comer should not lead me.
You can't say that! It's Souryuu who did silly thing.
Don't be rude! You were too hasty to beat, and result that matter.
You cannot say that to me.
Excuse me, where is Misatosan?
Hello, I'm back.... but no one here..
What What made you here.
Still here?
Ah!! Oh, no!
What do you mean?
Well, eh..
Oh, no, no good to triumph over them..
Job. Overnight job, she said in the phone.
WOW! Oh, no!
you are a child as well.
I know. Everything will be over in 62 seconds.
No! It's you that hit me first!
That was image training for the today's battle!
Unfair! You were awake that time?
No, I didn't. I stopped.
gggggggg ah!
Childish is you that said "MOM"!
Oh, I've expected it would be as it is.
Don't say in such a manner.
Studying science.
Well, I have to do. Oh!
It's simple!
How come you can solve this, while you get a bad result at the school exam
You say, you were not able to read the questions in Japanese?
University?
That's the problem of thermoexpansion.
I know that but...
Don't ask me! I have no idea!
Is this an Angel?
But, it must be me.
Then, I will,
What's that?
Who order such a thing?
Asuka, are you alright?
I've got it!
From Kajisan? What?
The Bath there to the left.
Phew... it's a heaven, heaven!
I've never realized this agreeable bathing.
OK. Here I go.
Oh, no! Expanding... shameful.
Er ... Err ... Well, Father.
Err, well ... Today at the school, I told me to report to my parent that an interview for career guidance will take place. But ...
I wonder about that. I thought that a failure occurred rather than he hung up.
Anyway let's make a contact with Nerv Headquarters.
Well. What shall we do?
What are you doing?
But the doors can't work. Ah, a manual door.
(Nn,nnnn) You rely on me only in such a situation.
It usually takes only two minutes to go there. Is true that this is a passage.
I heard the same words fourth times for some time.
Listen, what do you think Angels are?
Angels, messengers of the God. Our enemies of Angel names. Why are we fighting against them?
Hmmm, I don't know.
Something seems to be strange as I expected. The road leads up.
Stop it at such a time.
I can't open this door by my hands.
There is nothing for it but to see. If I don't see forward, I can't advanc...
How are Evas?
How? Although anything doesn't work.
What shall we do?
Sure but how are you going to do it? I dropped my rifle and the batteries on our backs are empty. We'll able to move for no more than three minutes.
It's so dangerous.
Ayanami! Asuka, clear the way!
It's ironic that the stars are very beautiful like this without electric artificial lights.
For that reason, I'm wonder if man is a special creature. So Angels are attacking against us.
She might be still asleep. Recently she had lots of work for all night job. ~twinji
Sheltering from rain.
What? What's happened to Misatosan?
I wonder when...
What do you mean?
Oh. －－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－ ~twinji
Congratulation for your promotion.
Oh, I understand that.
Being praised at that time, I was not that happy.
That resulted to make Asuka angry.
How come she got angry?
What made her angry?
But I am not that used to be with many people. Why must we make a fuss? Your promotion suggests that Misatosan is appreciated by people. doesn't it?
That's why they are happy. But you do not look happy.
Then, why did you join NERV?
My father is out here?
In the case that the Angel goes out of the course considerably ..?
The probability of win is?
Neither do I.
Steak means a gorgeous dinner!
No way for them.
It's nicer if she can lead us at ease.
The distance from the end to end is quite long.
Intuition?
Misatosan never hit the lot.
Obviously, To show my talent to the world.
To show your existence?
It asked Ayanami before.
It doesn't mean that.
I might be.
Just like my father.
Don't shirk away! , Don't shirk away! , Don't shirk away! So don't shirk away.
Here we go! Start! －－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－ S
Field to full! Uhh.
Right now!
Hey Misatosan.
When I heard my father's words, I found for the first time that it's glad to be praised. And I also found... that I pilot Eva to hear those words from my father.
Yes. Something is different from the other times.
What is going on.
I Feel something strange.
No, I mean, it smells of Ayanami...
WOW, what's this? Something is entering directly into my head, what? Ayanami? Ayanami Rei? It's Rei, this impression is Rei's. Ayanami? Aren't you?
Oh, No! I hate this ceiling. 
I am going to meet my father tomorrow. What do you think I shall talk about with him?
'cose I saw you enjoy talking with my father the other day.
Hey, what kind of man is my father?
Is that so.
Oh, when we were cleaning room today, you were wringing the floorcloth. You looked like a mother at that time.
Yeah. Yeah, that was just like the mother's way of wringing. I bet you become a housewife. (Laugh).
Since I escaped at that time, I've never come here. I don't feel like my mother sleeps here. I don't remember my mother's face.
Don't you have something like her photo?
As the teacher says, you casted everything.
Father! I mean, I am glad today, that I had a time to talk with you.
I've been learning since I was five, and this skill. I am not particulartly talented.
I began this following my teacher's advise. I could have quited immediately.
No one stopped me.
You come back early. I thought you would have a supper.
That's too cold.
hm, hm, alright. bye.
Yeah. She said she will be back very late. and said "go to bed before I'm back"
I don't think so, because she is with Kajisan.
Hm.. How come?
Nothing to do, so, kiss? It's ...
I don't care.
I don't. I can kiss.
Kajisan! ~twinj
Good night.
What's the matter? You seem depressed.
Yes,stock of dried bonito. That's Ritsukosan't souvenir.
I'm sorry.
ah,I'm sorry.
hmm..ah, Misatosan! How is the result of the test?
No! I am ready to do!
I'll show a good example for you,Asuka.
You told me,"YOU ARE NUMBER ONE".
(interupting Misato) To fight is manly job.
Ayanami,Asuka.How about your configurations?
You don't come? (I try to prevent it to leaving.)  R
What? Sh, Shadow! Ah,huah! What's this! Strange! 
hoah,whoa! Misatosan, what's going on? Misaosan! Asuka, Ayanami, cover me! Misatosan,can you hear me,Misatosan! 
Misatosan, Misatosan!
I never thought sleeping exhausts me. (Shinji activates monitor.) Still only white noise.  Rader and sonar has gotten no response.  Because this space is too vast.  12 hours after I switched to the lifesupportmode. Huh...  My life will end in 4 or 5 hours.  ..feel hungry.  
Mm... Water is getting muddy! Hug. Purification capacity is reducing.  Hah. M,m.. it smells.  blood, smells of blood.  Ha, No! I hate this place!  Why can't I release this lock!  Open! Let me out!  Misatosan!! What's going on, Misatosan!  Asuka! Ayanami!! Eee! Rituskosan! hug,  Father, hug, cough, m, g, mm,  Please, help me.  
Who? Who? Sh
I'm afraid of being hated.
You hate to be hurted. Who's bad ? Father is bad. Father who deserted me. ~twinji
Heck, it's me who can do nothin'.
(thought) I think I hate father. But I'm not sure.
Father called me by my name. I was praised by that my father. Sh
If I trust this word, heck, I can live on from now on.
Everyone does so. Huh, Doing so, people live. Sh
There're too many pains in this world for me to live. Sh
Human isn't made floatable.
It's selfdecetion.
I don't care whatever you refer to it.
You has been closing your eyes and turning your ears deaf against anything you did not want to know.  (flashback from the episode 3)
No, I don't want to hear that!
I found one thing I enjoy. Am I wrong if I do the thing enjoyable? 
Father, Am I a useless child ? Father!! ~twinji
It's from your side that you ran away. (flashback)
No! Mother smiled at ...  (flashback)
I hate this place, and loneliness.  The circulation of Oxygen ended here.  Fu, Fu, F, it's cold.  Fuah, No, Suit reaches its margin.  Now the end, hah, tired, haah, of everything. ~twinji
... I just wanted to see ..... again .....
Hm. But, I'm alright now.
(chuckles)
still smells, of blood.
Kensuke, how come?
La, Last night, I was busy at homework, so no time to cook.
Ayanami, let me in.
No other choice. She won't read if we put them into this.  ~twinji
Let me in.
OK, but Misatosan dislikes such a guy.
Sorry, I settled on my own accord. I touched nothing but rubbish.
Misatosan.
Ritsukosan expects you at the meeting for tomorrow's business trip.
I thought Kajisan be more serious.
Oh, sorry.
Water melon is this?
Also something painful.
I don't like.
How is your excursion to NewYokosuka, yesterday.
Eva Unit Three?
I've never heard of that.
I don't know.
I've no idea about that.
Really I don't know.
What is that?
I've never heard anything from Misatosan.
Uhm, where is Asuka?
Is the rumor of Unit 4 being lost was true? I heard there was an accident and Unit 4 was brown up.
But I heard Unit 3 is coming from U.S.. The activation test will take place at Matsushiro, right?
But how about the test?
But how about the pilot?
Huh? Coming!
What's wrong. You left home much earlier than me but you are pretty late.
I can't see him anywhere.
Yes, he is acting weird recently.
Who will pilot the Unit 3?
Are you asleep already, Mr.Kaji?
What kind of person my father is?
It seems you are always with him.
I wasn't with him for a long time...
But I understood many things about my father recently. About his job, about my mother. So,...
Is that fit with your relationships with Misato, too?
I cannot understand the grownups.
Yes. I think it arrived yesterday.
An accident at Matsushiro? No... How about Misato?
Oh, no. What should I do?
But we have to go against the Angel by our own...
My father is...?
What? No way. An Angel? You mean that is an Angel?
The target? That is EVA.
Does it pilotted by a kid, just like the other units? The kid of same age?
Asuka! ~twinji
But there is a person inside, father.
But I cannot do that. I have to save the one. I cannot kill a person.
I don't care. It's much better than killing someone.
No! Father, no! Please stop doing this!
Misato, you were OK.
Misato, I've...I've... My father... I begged him not to...
Still alive.
Noooooooooo!
That's not my concern.
Don't make me more angry by saying such things! 185 seconds are left to Unit One. This is enough for destroying at least half of the Headquarters.
I'm saying that's not my concern! My father ... that man was going to kill Touji, by these hands of mine. 
Father, you are there, aren't you? Say something; answer me!
I still have a direct connect.... ug, ghuahah, ahg, darn, darn, d, darn... Male
I couldn't forgive my father, who betrayed me. Though finally I could have a nice talk with him, My father doesn't understand my feeling at all.
I said "I did"!
Isn't it all right? What's wrong with running away from disagreeable things?
Yes, I don't want to pilot EVA any more. I don't want to stay here either.
I will. I'll return where the Teacher is.
I intend we won't.
I assume Asuka won't come, being speechless.
It's becoming to her. I'm relieved.
That's your way of life, Misatosan. I can't follow that.
I know. Um....
Tell me just one thing; Why it's Touji... the Fourth ChildREN...?
Everyone, everyone in the class...
It's a selfish cause, isn't it?
It's no use. Please do away with them. I won't pilot EVA any more.
It's an Angel.
(I decided not to pilot any more...)
Asuka... ~twinji
Kajisan. What are you doing in the place like this?
I, I won't pilot EVA any more. Since I decided so...
In such a time?
Ayanami! Even without a rifle! ~twi
Ugh, guhh. ~twinji
Hh, Huhh...
Let me pilot! Let me, me, pilot this, Unit One! Father...
Ngh, I, I am the pilot of Evangelion Unit One, Ikari Shinji! 
Misatosan!
The power run out! ~twin
Move, move, move. Move, please move. There is no use if it doesn't move now! Ahg! ~twinji
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, move, please move! If it doesn't move now, if I don't do it now, everyone's going to die! I can't stand such a thing any more. So, please move! ~twin
What's this? Where am I? Entryplug of Unit One? Nobody is here. I'm not. What's this? What's this? What's this? I don't know. These people. Yes. The people who I know, the people who know me. I see. Everything is in my world. What's this? I don't know it although this is my world. An image from outside. An unpleasant image. I see. An enemy. ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY. Our enemies called Angel which have the angelic names. Evs's and Nerv's target. Revenge of Misato's father. Why am I fighting? I go so far as to have such a bitter experience.
I don't need the reason? I shouldn't think of it? ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY, EVERYONE IS ENEMY! Something threatening me, us. It means ENEMY. Definitely. Nobody think badly of me if I myself protect my life, our lives! ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY, ENEMY. My ENEMY! My ENEMY!! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! You injured Toji and killed Mother! Father. Uhhhhhh!
Of course. A father like him.
Of course because I have hardly ever met him.
Yes. Father don't need me. Father deserted me.
Definitely. It must be the truth! I was deserted because he had Ayanami.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Father is to be totally blamed! Then I was going to tell him that I hated him.
Are you telling me to get into this and have fearful experiences, Father?
What! I won't. What are you saying now?! Father, can't you need me?
I can't. I can't do that because I've never seen it nor heard it.
No. I knew it. I remember. I knew Eva. And then I ran away from Father and Mother.
Comfortable. Warm. This is human warmth, isn't this? I've never had it.
I've never known it. But I seem to know it.
I've never known it. But I seem to know it.
It's because I'm a pilot of Eva. They are kind to me because I get into Eva. It's the reason why I can stay here. It's all which support me. So I must get into Eva.
Enemy. Yes, I must fight against the ones which everyone calls enemies.
I must win. Yes, I mustn't lose. I must get into Eva as they say and I must win as they say. Otherwise, nobody, nobody, nobody ...
Misatosan, Ritsukosan, Asuka, Toji, Kensuke and Father praise me. They praise me because I get into Eva. The fellow like me. Everyone tells me to get into it. Father does. I'll show him what I can do.
I'm doing my best. I am. Please be kind to me. I've been fighting so much. I'm fighting as well as I can. Take care of me, please. Be kind to me!
I can't get it. I can't get it. I, I ...
This place?
In Eva? I've got into Eva again, haven't I? Why?
I've decided that I'll never get into Eva any further?
Smell. I smell someone. Misatosan? Ayanami? No, it doesn's smell them. I got it. It smells Mother.
Hai, Hello...
An international call from Germany to Asuka. It's your mother.
(Monologue ) ( Listening her speaking unfamiliar language, I feel as if Asuka were a stranger.)
Mother.... 
It's a very long phone call.
I envy. Family talk...
I will take the field with Unit1.
So you mean it's OK if I am not defeated.
But, in this situation, Asuka will ....
I am glad as you are OK, Asuka.
Misatosan's shutting herself up today as ever.
Asuka, she isn't getting back today?
Misatosan. Never come out the tears. I think I am sad, but never come out the tears.
Stop! No, Misatosan.
I'm glad, You are alive! My father is not here? Thank you! You saved me.
You saved me even by abandoning Unit Zero.
Yeah. Don't you remember that?
Hi, Hello.
Ritsukosan,,
This looks just like Ayanami's room.
In this room?
The tomb place for Evas.
Ayanami Rei,, Aha!
Human? Is that a human?
You betray me!
Ayanami Rei, That may be true... that impression. My mom's .. Rei and my Mom, ,, What is my daddy doing for these two.
Where has Asuka been. (What should I talk with her? Story about Ayanami?)
(Touji, Kensuke lost their house here and went to somewhere. No friend, I have no friend here. No one. I don't want to see Ayanami. I lost the courage to see her. How shall I behave before her? Asuka, Misatosan, Mom, What Shall I do? What!
You know my name?
Is that so? Well, who are you?
Fifth children!? Are you? Nagisakun?
Alright, call me Shinji.
Oh, no I did ,, I don't mean so.
Well, the usual test was over and, I am going to have a shower before I go home. Yet, I don't want to go home these days.
Is that so?
Oh, yes. I don't mean NO. ~twinj
That's the time.
We have to go to bed.
Oh, well, you have your own different provided room.
Favourable?
Oh, you need not. It's me that asked you to let me here. I'm OK that I sleep here.
I've experienced many things after I came here. I was at my teacher's before. Silent and calm days. I did nothing but exist. It was OK with me. I had nothing to do.
Well, I don't care people. except for my father that I hate. (Why am I talking about this kinda things to Kaorukun?)
NO NO NO, MUST BE A LIE! Kaorukun is an Angel? That MUST BE LIE!
You betrayed me! You betrayed my mind! You betrayed like my father!
You are here.
Kaorukun..
Asuka! Sorry!
Kaorukun STOP! I don't see Why.
A.T. Field!
I don't understand that! Kaorukun!
GU,,GAAAAA,, O
gggggg, Kaorukun!
Kaorukun, why?
What, What are you talking about? Kaorukun! I don't figure out what are you talking about! Kaorukun!
Kaorukun, said "I love you." To me! For the first time, for the first time I heard the words. He looks like me. He looks like Ayanami. I loved him. It is Kaorukun that must have survived. He was much better than I am. He should have survived.
You are cold, Misatosan.
There was no other choice!  Why killed? ~twinji
Because Kaorukun was, He was an Angel!  Although he is a human as well? ~twinji
No! Angel! He was our enemy!  Although he was a human as well? ~twinji
NO! NO! I SAY NO!
NO! Angel is he.
THAT'S RIGHT! Otherwise, we'd be killed. Everybody'd be killed.
I did not want to kill him. Yet, there's no other choice!
Help!  So killed. ~twinji
Help!  So killed. ~twinji
Help!  So killed. ~twinji
Somebody help me!  So killed. ~twinji
I hope! Is there anybody! Somebody help me!
Yes. It's Kaorukun that must have survived. He was much better than I am. He should have survived.
Is that really so?  Anxiety
Was that what I wished?  Obsession ~twinji
I don't figure out. What shall I do? What Shall I DO!
What?  What do you fear? ~twinji
Me.  What do you fear? ~twinji
to be disliked.  What do you fear? ~twinji
By whom?  What do you fear? ~twinji
Who?  What do you fear? ~twinji
That's my father! He deserted me! I was disliked. What shall I do if disliked? What shall I do? ~twinji
Where am I? Where shall I go? Nothing visible. Nothing inteligible. ... Misatosan? Misatosan! Hey, where are you? Hey, where shall I go from now on? Misatosan! Asuka! Ayanami! Touji! Kensuke! Ritsukosan! Kajisan! Father! Mother! Tell me, What I should do! ~twinji
Evangelion Unit One.
I have to pilot this, after all, killing the one that I loved, obaying the words from my father and others. You say I must fight on this? Mom! say something! answer me!
'Cause People ask me to pilot.
Isn't it OK? It's for the sake of everybody! Isn't it OK?
Yes! That is a good thing. That is a very good thing. Everyone prases me, then.
Is that so? ~twinj
Is that so?
That might be.
That might be.
What feeling is this? That is what I feel like I experienced before. My body seems like dispearing. Agreeable. I feel like spreading, and becoming large, to here, there and everywhere.  That was the very begining of the complimentation of the people by the instrumentality of man.
This is the me within your mind.
In ordert for me to find me, I have to feel many kinda people. I have to gaze inside of me. I have to gaze the Misatosan within me. What do you hope?  You wanna be a good child.
Stop, Misatosan.
Otherwise, we cannot live? ~twinji
We are unstable unless we are together.
It's my mind within Asuka.
What do you hope?
Don't leave me.
What's this?
This is the truth. The result of everything, is this?
NO. It's that nobody saved me.
What's the reality?
It's the the world where everything is already set isn't it?
This darkness, this incomlete world,, Do you say, all of these did I wish?
Yet, I can disappear because I think I am useless.
After all, I am a useless child. Nobody cares me.
Probably for myself.
I don't like that.
I don't run away.
If ran away, it would be more painful.
It was painful.
Yet, I don't. I don't want to run away. No. I shall not run away.
I say, if ran away, nobody would care me. Don't desert me! I hope! Don't desert me!
Right! Otherwise, I would be deserted.
Shut up! That's nothing to do with me. People don't care me.
NO BODY ACCEPTS ME.
So, I have to pilot Eva.
I have to do so.
I am valueless. I have nothing to be prode of.
Piloting Eva lets me be myself.
Before piloting Eva, I had nothing. The fact that I pilot Eva lets me stay here.
I have nothing. NOTHING.
No don't I have. I hate myself.
Now, everybody hates me. Probably, people hate me.
NO. Because I hate myself.
But, I am praised. I am praised when I pilot Eva. I was praised.
I was praised by people!
I don't know, or, both of them are my true minds.
I have nothing but Eva.
It's OK. I've had nothing from the begining. I've been learning cello, but results nothing.
But, now that I can pilot Eva.
Because it's all of me. 
Rain, gloomy mood, just like my mood. I don't like that.
Blue sky. Something warm, something not used to, something horrible. something useless. I don't like that.
What I fear is,
May I stay by you?
Don't you wanna go your dad's?
No, I don't.
I fear to be haten.
Before that, I need. I need my value. In order to be appreciated, in order not to be deserted,
I don't have any value.
Then what am I?
What the hell am I?
What? It's me. The shape that I show to others, the symbol representing me. This, and this, and this all these are the representation of me. Nothing but the things that make others cognize me. What am I? This is me? The true me? The false me?
Let's see. My clothes, my shoes, my room. Those are part of myself.
The thing that I think myself is me. I am nothing but myself. Yet, I don't understand. Where am I? What am I? What am I? Nobody understands me.
But still I don't have myself, so I don't understand myself. There's no way to take care of myself.
What? The world with nothing. The world with nobody.
The world of freedom.
The world of freedom that would never be restrained by anybody.
Is this Freedom?
Yes. The world of freedom.
unless I think.
What's the hell! I don't know what I should do.
Too vague.
What shall I do?
Is this my will?
This is the world with nothing, the space with nothing, the world with nothing. The world with nothing but me. I am getting less understand myself. I feel as if I am going to disappear. My existence is fading away.
Nobody but me?
Because there are others, I can exist. If alone, I am always alone at anywhere. The world is entirely by my ..
Yes. I am I. Yet, it's true that others form the shape of my mind.
Oh, it's you, Asuka?
Ah,, I mean thanx, so, let me sleep a little more.
It's morning. It's natural.
OK, I know, You are too noisy.
I hear that today we also have a new comer.
Right. What kinda girl? I hope a cute girl!
(breathing)
Oh Ouch! Ouch!
I did not intend to see but, only a moment,..
He will be controled [after he gets married], Touji will.
How come you say I will be controled?
Asuka, You are always speak ..
I've got it. This is also a world. The possiblity within me. The me at the moment is not always the me as I am. There are many myselves. Yes. There must be the me who is not the Eva pilot.
The real world might not always be bad. Yet, I hate myself.
Yet, don't you hate me?
Yet, I hate myself.
I am wicked, coward, weak and ..
I hate myself. But, I might be able to love myself. I might be allowed to stay here. Yes. I am nothing but I. I am I. I wish to be I. I wish to stay here as do I. I can stay here as do I!
Thank you!
!! Asuka!!
(A scream.)
Damn it, hang it, blast it!!
Ayanami!? Rei!? 
(A scream.)
(A scream.)
I can't bear this any more, I can't bear this any more. I can't bear this any more, I can't bear this any more...
Were you there, Kaworukun?
It's so! It's the same as when I begin a cello. When I come here, I thought that something would be here. 
So I seem to be you? Little
Is.. is Misatosan doing such a thing? 
I'll know you. 
I cannot know your thing. Because Asuka says nothing to me. It's impossible to say that you wants me to knows your thing. You tell nothing to me though!!
I willed to know it. 
Therefore, will you be kind to me? 
It's a lie!! They must be deceived by the face laughed at me! They must want to make it vague!! 
A vague thing only corners me... 
I'm scared at it just like this. Anyone mayn't needs me someday! I get flustered, I'm not calm, tell me a voice! Keep me mate! Anyone cares about me!!
I want to be useful for you. I want to be here much together with you. 
Hey, Asuka, help me. Hey, one must be Asuka so that I may be saved, will you?
Please, help.. me... 
Help, hey, help me. Let you help me, anyone helps me. Help, help!!!!!!!
Help me!!!!!
Don't leave me alone!! Don't desert me!! Don't kill me!!
No one knew my thing. 
I thought that there was the world which never wavered and not to be unpleasant in. 
You betrayed me! You betrayed my hoping!! 
Anyone doesn't surely need me. Therefore, anyone is to dies. 
Anyone is the same even though I'm here or not. Nothing changes. Therefore, anyone is to dies. 
I'd better not rather be here. Therefore, I'm to die too. 
May I be here...? A
(A scream.)
Tell you what... 
What's a dream? 
I don't know it. I don't know reality well. 
I don't know where my happiness is. 
Therefore, this is not reality. No one is in this world. 
Therefore, I'm not here. 
Must not I do it? 
Must not I dream a dream for me? 
Where is my dream? 
Where is my reality? 
Hmmm... Ayanami.....? Where is this? 
Did I die? 
But...this is wrong. I thought this is wrong. 
It's still okay with me...
Thank you.
I felt that there was only unpleasant. Therefore, I was allowed to run away from there certainly. However, there was not pleasant in the place where I ran away. Because I'm not there, it's the same as no one is here. 
Yes. However, what are you who are in my heart?
But, it's the thing that makebelieves. It's that I believed freely. It's the thing like a grace. They cannot last all the time. They'll betray me someday. They'll desert me...
I thought that I wanted to meet them again. Because I think that my feeling is true...
I don't know where my happiness is yet. However, I'm here, I'll keep thinking about the meaning that I'm born here from this as well. But, I must notice that they' re natural things many times. To I'm here by myself...
However, what did mum to do?
Goodbye, my mum.
(Groaning.)
(Groaning.)
Yet, I can disappear because I think I'm useless.
After all, I am a useless child. Nobody cares about me.
Probably for myself.
I don't like it.
I can't run away.
If I ran away, it would be more painful.
It was painful.
But, I won't. I don't want to run away. No. I shall not run away.
I said, if I ran away, nobody would care about me. Don't desert me! Please! Don't desert me!
Right! Otherwise, I would be deserted.
Shut up! That's nothing to do with me. People don't care about me.
NOBODY ACCEPTS ME.
So, I have to pilot Eva.
I have to do that.
I am worthless. I have nothing to be proud of.
Piloting Eva lets me be myself.
Before piloting Eva, I had nothing. The fact that I pilot Eva lets me stay here.
I have nothing. NOTHING.
No don't I have it. I hate myself.
Now, everybody hates me. Probably, people hate me.

I was praised by people!
I don't know, or, both of them are my true hearts.
I have nothing but Eva.
It's OK. I've had nothing from the beginning. I've been learning cello, but it didn't go anywhere.
But, now that I can pilot Eva.
Because it's all of me. 
Rain, gloomy mood, just like my mood. I don't like that.
Blue sky. Something warm, something unfamiliar, something horrible. something useless. I don't like that.
What I fear is,
May I stay with you?
Don't you wanna go your to your dad's?
No, I don't.
I fear to be hated.
Before that, I need. I need my worth. In order to be appreciated, in order not to be deserted,
I don't have any value.
Then what am I?
What the hell am I?

This is the world of nothing, space with nothing, the world of nothing. The world with nothing but me. I am understanding myself less. I feel as if I'm going to disappear. My existence is fading away.
Nobody but me?
Because there are others, I can exist. If alone, I am always alone anywhere. The world is entirely from me..
Yes. I am I. Yet, it's true that others form the shape of my mind.
Oh, it's you, Asuka?
Ah, I mean thanks, so, let me sleep a little more...
It's morning, I can't help it.
OK, I know, You're so noisy.
I hear that today we have a newcomer.
Right. What kinda girl? I hope she's cute!
(breathing)
Oh Ouch! Ouch!
I didn't mean to look, but, only a little...
Touji is gonna be whipped.
How come you're saying I'll be whipped?
Asuka, You're always talking ..
I've got it. This is also a world. The possibility within me. The me at the moment is not always the me as I am. There are many of myself. Yes. There must be a me who is not an Eva pilot.
The real world might not always be bad. But, I hate myself.
But, don't you hate me?
Yet, I hate myself.
I am wicked, cowardly, weak and ..
I hate myself. But, I might be able to love myself. I might be allowed to stay here. Yes. I am nothing but I. I am I. I wish to be I. I want to stay here! I can stay here!
Thank you!
